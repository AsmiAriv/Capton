"It also gave Stacey a secret. He knew that Mattias didn't know much about cooking. No spice, or assortment of spices, could possibly remove the taste of Andrill from potatoes. Potatoes are like sponges, they soak up every flavor around them. The trick to removing Andrill from them was not in the cooking, but in the sack they were carried in. Stacey's mother, before she died, taught Stacey how to make a sack, and what to make it out of, that cleaned produce in such a way that it pulled out contaminants, like Andrill in general. The flavor of Andrill was out of those potatoes a few hours after Stacey was on the boat. It still made him happy though, because potatoes, like sponges, really have no flavor all by themselves. So, for Mattias to have said anything, Stacey did have his spices right. His mashed potatoes were good. Come out of Andrill and still deserve praise good."

"Of course the question ""Why do you like horror films?"" is an unfair. You might as well say why do you like the color blue? Because it appeals to me. Why does it appeal to you? Who knows? I don’t think any of us really know where our tastes come from. Why certain things strike cords within us. Of course no one asks such things about our nice socially expectable tastes. Nobody turns to me in the middle of a conversation and asks me with an air of J’Accuse and demands to know why I prefer Chopin to Mahler. Or why I like the poems of Czelaw Milosz. Nobody says “How dare you edify your perverted sensibilities with David Mitchell and Dennis Lehane!” I don’t catch people glaring at me when I wear a Ramones shirt the same way I sometimes do when I go out in one of my horror shirts."

Rest assured the grog will not just sit in my fridge and be necked whilst I lounge on the couch farting and watching documentaries on channel four about fat kids, and laughing my head off when they run.

"Besides the health, financial, and environmental reasons, there is of course the ethical reason. Is it correct that 70 Billion animals are raised each year only to become food for humans? The vast majority of these animals live lives of such unimaginable squalor and suffering as to dull the senses. There seems to be a widespread idea that animals, for some reason, don’t feel pain or suffering like humans, or that they only exist to feed humans. These are such juvenile ideas that they would almost be laughable if they weren’t so repugnant. Notwithstanding the active abuse dished out to untold numbers of animals and the horrible conditions that they inhabit during their short, sad lives, the worst part of this issue is the fact that most humans feel that there is nothing wrong in our very mentally which justifies the slavery and subservience of all other animals to our appetites and whims, and that humans are naturally superior and ordained to dominate and rule the earth because we are the most intelligent species. This is an example of an intelligence I want no part of. We are animals too, and this slavery and abuse is unacceptable and should not be tolerated or even allowed."
"Pila could provide us with the blueprint on how to salvage what’s left of our old towns without needing big money. When conservation is the discussion, individuals and groups always talk about money – but I feel that attitude is as important as funding.

"West quickly pointed out that the Koran was written long before America even existed and that it does indeed tell believers to kill infidels, and then proceeded to chronicle a lengthy list of historical Muslim acts of aggression. Congressman West closed his retort by referencing the Fort Hood shootings and 9-11 attacks, saying that his first hand experiences on the battlefield has given him insight into the tactics that Islamists use before telling Hamze not to “try to blow sunshine up my butt” with his criticism of him.

No, ordinarily, I don’t buy boxed cereals for the boys. And I’m not sure how proud I am of the purchase.

"But you will notice that Jesus’ resurrection body carries the scars of his crucifixion. As we all carry scars, I’m sure. Life becomes ever more complex and perplexing, to borrow two words from our Lent book. We end up with scars. These scars don’t evaporate, even in the light of the resurrection. But perhaps they do have their uses. Macabre as is sounds, they helped Thomas, and Jesus offered him exactly what he wanted – to put his hand in his nail marks and in his side. Perhaps, believing in the resurrection, even our scars become part of our sending."
"“In 1995, neurotoxicologist and former Director of toxicology at Forsyth Dental Center in Boston, Dr. Phyllis Mullenix published research showing that fluoride built up in the brains of animals when exposed to moderate levels. Damage to the brain occured and the behavior patterns of the animals was adversely effected. Offspring of pregnant animals receiving relatively low doses of fluoride showed permanent effects to the brain which were seen as hyperactivity (ADD-like symptoms). Young animals and adult animals given fluoride experienced the opposite effect — hypoactivity or sluggishness. The toxic effects of fluoride on the central nervous system was subsequently confirmed by previously-classified government research. Two new epidemiological studies which tend to confirm fluoride’s neurotoxic effects on the brain have shown that children exposed to higher levels of fluoride had lower IQs.”"

"In this system, it's acceptable to let a 70 year old, die while giving care to a 25 year old, because their life is worth more to the collective - excuse me - worth more to society.

Everyone who is now 70 was once 25 and the majority of those who are 25 now will be 70 some day"". In other words, ""we can screw you now because we didn't screw you earlier; and if we're not screwing you now, wait until you're 70 and then you'll really be screwed.""

"WWII is entering its last phase: Germany is in ruins, but does not yield. The US army lacks crucial knowledge about the German units operating on the opposite side of the Rhine, and decides to send two German prisoners to gather information. The scheme is risky: the Gestapo retains a terribly efficient network to identify and capture spies and deserters. Moreover, it is not clear that “Tiger”, who does not mind any dirty work as long as the price is right, and war-weary “Happy”, who might be easily betrayed by his feelings, are dependable agents. After Tiger and another American agent are successfully infiltrated, Happy is parachuted in Bavaria.

"Adoption specialists point out that adoptees often feel anger in response to being given away by birth parents, feeling like second class citizens, and feeling unworthy of having anything good happen to them. We must also stay mindful of the fact that many adoptees come from backgrounds where there is a family history of poor impulse control, psychiatric disorders, substance abuse, or other factors that can contribute to a poor modulation of emotions. Thus, when the child is angry, he may have little recognition or control over how intense his response is. Also, children who grew up in violent or chaotic environments had aggression and rage modeled for them and they quickly learn that it is an effective way of getting attention and perhaps even getting one’s needs met."

"Anyhoo, long story short, lots and lots of blacks in my last neighborhood. Like, every other house. So I was jogging in one of the tonier areas of my neighborhood and there are two dogs in the front yard of this one house. They went after me like I was made out of ham. All I got was a tiny nip on the ankle. They weren’t large dogs, but they were large enough to put a scare in me. Scared, angry me stood in the middle of the street, kind of paralyzed, screaming for the home owners to get their fucking dogs. A large black man comes out of the house behind me. I snippily ask if these are his dogs. He patiently says “No.” and proceeds to clear the way for me. The dogs are intimidated by his height and decidedly not-defensive posture. They slunk away. I offered an effusive “Thank you, Sir!” and continued jogging home. I was shaken. But felt extraordinarily grateful for the nice, big, calm guy who came to my rescue. More big black guys for my neighborhood, please."

It was actually great - although old, the equipment seemed quite well maintained, and it was excellent to see some of those old styles of activities - giant see-saws (I went on one and was quite freaked out - now that I comprehend danger to a greater extent it is far more exhilarating!) a double slide, those twirly cups you sit in, and a menagerie of bouncy animals."

I used a small off-set spatula to carefully scrape the cream off one side of the cookie and put it on the other side that had the majority of the cream filling. Then, using that spatula (having the small off-set spatula ~ you know, the kind for smoothing frosting on cakes, cupcakes ~ really made this job easy) I smoothed the cream as best as possible."

And by the way, we all know that both these neighboring countries were pitched against each other to neutralize each other and create a conflict zone in the Middle East to suit global arms dealers’ desires. Both Iran and Iraq got used and abused by the West, including the US. The intention was only one: to gain forever access to their huge Oil reserves in order to satiate their ever growing energy demands.

"When I was growing up this was a very common dish in my house. My Mom would make this super-simple fried tofu at least twice a week as a snack, an appetizer, or a side dish in a larger Asian-style meal. When I visit my mother in Atlanta we eat it at every evening meal. We’ve been eating this same tofu dish for years and years because it is utterly delicious and surprisingly addictive. The mild curd develops unexpected flavors (sweet, a little sour, a little nutty) when fried, and the crisp edges give it textural interest and a nice chew. Dipped in something as simple as soy sauce, maybe with a little fiery chili paste in it, the little soy bean curd pillows are delightfully fun to eat as you pop them in your mouth. When I married Regina I discovered that she too loves this dish, which made me realize anew that fried tofu is ubiquitous in Asia. Fried tofu eclipses class and culture and politics — pretty much everyone who eats it loves it. Certainly my whole family loves it, including my tofu-obsessed father and my eight-year old son Bennet."

The crux of it all is why we are this way, and it is because we have an inaccurate view of God. We see Him as a benevolent Being who is satisfied when people manage to fit Him into their lives in some small way. We forget that God never had an identity crisis. He knows that He's great and deserves to be the center of our lives. Jesus came humbly as a servant, but He never begs us to give Him some small part of ourselves.

"So that’s the main thing I remember about that film. And then, of course, it was a disaster when it came out - and almost immediately it also turned into a cult film – and it still is! Frankly, I don’t quite understand why – except that there’s no movie remotely like it. I saw it again a little over 10 years ago at a film festival in Dallas. They wanted me to come down because they couldn’t get anyone else so I went. And the category it was in was called “Films We Love to Hate”. And I thought wait a minute, they didn’t tell me that! And then I was interviewed in front of an audience at a midnight showing. They were asking me about Otto Preminger. And I said he was one of the great film directors and everybody laughed out loud. Then I started to list a number of movies that are remarkable and have some range. And at every one I said, they would laugh. “Wait a minute,” I said, “This is not being fair.” “Yeah, but Skidoo - we hear it’s terrible.” And I said, “Every film director who’s made a lot of movies has made a couple that don’t work – and by the way Skidoo does have a following.” So then I settled down with them to watch the film and I was like, “Oh God, it is terrible. It’s awful.” He was trying for something original and unusual – and he was challenging himself – but he didn’t know how to do it. It just wasn’t his thing."

"Adoption specialists point out that adoptees often feel anger in response to being given away by birth parents, feeling like second class citizens, and feeling unworthy of having anything good happen to them. We must also stay mindful of the fact that many adoptees come from backgrounds where there is a family history of poor impulse control, psychiatric disorders, substance abuse, or other factors that can contribute to a poor modulation of emotions. Thus, when the child is angry, he may have little recognition or control over how intense his response is. Also, children who grew up in violent or chaotic environments had aggression and rage modeled for them and they quickly learn that it is an effective way of getting attention and perhaps even getting one’s needs met."

"ONCE UPON A TIME, a little boy with a big sword went into battle against Mister Rogers. Or maybe, if the truth be told, Mister Rogers went into battle against a little boy with a big sword, for Mister Rogers didn’t like the big sword. It was one of those swords that really isn’t a sword at all; it was a big plastic contraption with lights and sound effects, and it was the kind of sword used in defense of the universe by the heroes of the television shows that the little boy liked to watch. The little boy with the big sword did not watch Mister Rogers. In fact, the little boy with the big sword didn’t know who Mister Rogers was, and so when Mister Rogers knelt down in front of him, the little boy with the big sword looked past him and through him, and when Mister Rogers said, “Oh, my; that’s a big sword you have,” the boy didn’t answer, and finally his mother got embarrassed and said, “Oh, honey, c’mon, that’s Mister Rogers,” and felt his head for fever. Of course, she knew who Mister Rogers was, because she had grown up with him, and she knew that he was good for her son, and so now, with her little boy zombie-eyed under his blond bangs, she apologized, saying to Mister Rogers that she knew he was in a rush and that she knew he was here in Penn Station taping his program and that her son usually wasn’t like this, he was probably just tired …. Except that Mister Rogers wasn’t going anywhere. Yes, sure, he was taping, and right there, in Penn Station in New York City, were throngs of other children wiggling in wait for him, but right now his patient gray eyes were fixed on the little boy with the big sword, and so he stayed there, on one knee, until the little boy’s eyes finally focused on Mister Rogers, and he said, “It’s not a sword; it’s a death ray.” A death ray! Oh, honey, Mommy knew you could do it …. And so now, encouraged, Mommy said, “Do you want to give Mister Rogers a hug, honey?” But the boy was shaking his head no, and Mister Rogers was sneaking his face past the big sword and the armor of the little boy’s eyes and whispering something in his ear–something that, while not changing his mind about the hug, made the little boy look at Mister Rogers in a new way, with the eyes of a child at last, and nod his head yes."

"With just a tiny bit of prep during the weekend, a plate of delicious scrambled eggs is less than 5 minutes away. Seriously. You can time it. I’ll provide a recipe for you to try out, but really, the perfect weekday eggs are more of a method. When you have a little extra free time in the kitchen, pull out your food processor and puree some scramble-worthy vegetables and olive oil. I used a tomato, shallot, and parsley but I think mushrooms, zucchini, and/or spinach would be other good options. Store the concoction in the fridge and use it as the base for your scrambled eggs when you’re in a hurry. As a bonus, I found that this method yields consistently nice, soft scrambled eggs (as opposed to those dry, overcooked bits you might get when you’re rushing to get out the door and trying to multi-task…oops.) I’m not sure why this is, but I’ll take it."

Emma could bring a dowry and the necessary resources needed to fight the Vikings, so AEthelred offered her marriage."

"We stayed in Chennai for a few days and then decided to get a train to Pondicherry. I had wanted to visit Pondicherry ever since reading a wonderful book, Life of Pi, which begins in that city. Pondicherry is still heavily influenced by all things French as it was formerly a French colony. There are lots of very pretty pastel houses in streets with French names and in fact the city is divided into the French quarter and the Indian quarter and lots of people living there speak in French, which was bit disconcerting! It sits beside the Bay of Bengal and has lovely stretches of clean beaches and plenty of interesting shops. It`s known as a holiday get away for Indians and we liked it so much we stopped there for several days. Indian women go paddling in their sari`s and it`s just incredibly rich and colourful to see. The police, many of them women, wear uniforms of pale and dark blue camouflage. One time I bought some candy floss from a guy on the beach and a police officer came up to him rapping his knuckle with her baton, she told him to give me more bags and that he had ripped me off, as if I really minded. The only strange event I witnessed was when a very, very old lady came on to the beach, she was filthy dirty and obviously had some sort of mental health issue. Smiling and laughing to herself, she slowly twirled around on the sand then gradually lifting her swirling skirts she sank to the beach and poo`d. Nobody seemed to mind and that`s India for you."

As Kevin copes with living in a new place and dealing with his father’s criticisms, he becomes more and more interested in the mystery of Angus Seaton.

Meanwhile, a second, intertwined story tells of Angus Seaton, a crewman on the Mackay-Bennett, who helped retrieve bodies and identify bodies after the Titantic went down. In the end, Kevin pieces together the story of the inheritance and how it’s connected to Seaton, the Titantic and a young female ghost."
"Obviously, America is not a post-racist country. The blurry line dividing the other two appellations — racism and racialism — is crossed daily in overt and subtle ways. The line’s vagueness and the sometimes inadvertent crossing of it reflect the very different American experiences of blacks and whites. The recent shooting death in Sanford,Florida, of unarmed, 17-year-old Trayvon Martin by a self-appointed neighborhood watch captain, for instance, was seen by many blacks as another instance of racial profiling. But feelings of outrage and sadness and a demand for justice crossed all racial borders."

"The movie shoot, filmed on the Kennish property, looks pretty nifty for something thrown together in a week. Regina seems a little taken aback by the money being spent, with props, make-up, wind, and smoke machines. Daphne is also a little reserved, but it’s clear she’s noticing little things around the house that reflect the childhood she didn’t have, such as Bay and Toby’s handprints in a garden stone. Filming is set to begin, but Toby can’t figure out how to work the borrowed (from Simone/Buckner) video equipment, so Simone is brought in to shoot the movie. Emmett and Simone play off barely knowing each other, but he texts her to leave (since she doesn’t know sign).

According to this view, our existence (action, suffering, willing, feeling) has no meaning: the pathos of ""in vain"" is the nihilists' pathos--at the same time, as pathos, an inconsistency on the part of the nihilists."
"So, when we arrived at the wedding, I was not feeling so confident, nor very fragrant or sophisticated. My hair was frizzy, my silk jacket wrapped firmly around me.

"Jonathan has talked about sky surfer in Heerenveen for years, and when my dad was there alone with him two years ago they tried it out together; mom and Ryan had also gotten a shot at it before we’d arrived, so John and I were the only newbies. I bravely (and excitedly) volunteered to ride first. (And since I was on the sky surfer, the following photos were taken by Jonathan.)"

"""The object of this Essay is to assert one very simple principle, as entitled to govern absolutely the dealings of society with the individual in the way of compulsion and control, whether the means used be physical force in the form of legal penalties, or the moral coercion of public opinion. That principle is, that the sole end for which mankind are warranted, individually or collectively, in interfering with the liberty of action of any of their number, is self-protection. That the only purpose for which power can be rightfully exercised over any member of a civilised community, against his will, is to prevent harm to others. His own good, either physical or moral, is not a sufficient warrant. He cannot rightfully be compelled to do or forbear because it will be better for him to do so, because it will make him happier, because, in the opinions of others, to do so would be wise, or even right. These are good reasons for remonstrating with him, or reasoning with him, or persuading him, or entreating him, but not for compelling him, or visiting him with any evil in case he do otherwise. To justify that, the conduct from which it is desired to deter him must be calculated to produce evil to some one else. The only part of the conduct of any one, for which he is amenable to society, is that which concerns others. In the part which merely concerns himself, his independence is, of right, absolute. Over himself, over his own body and mind, the individual is sovereign."""
"Over the past 40 years, median house prices have doubled relative to household incomes in the Golden State. Why? In 1998, Dartmouth economist William Fischel found that California's housing had been nearly as affordable as the rest of the nation until the more restrictive regulations, such as development moratoria, urban growth boundaries, and overly expensive impact fees came into effect starting in the 1970s. Other economic studies, such as by Stephen Malpezzi at the University of Wisconsin, also have documented the strong relationship between more intense land-use regulations and exorbitant house prices."
"Apparently there is no need to discover if allegations are true nowadays. Just the fact that someone has been accused by anonymous sources is enough to convict - at least in the press. So much for innocent until proven guilty. Proof of a settlement is no proof at all, particularly when it comes to sexual harassment allegations. It is routine for large companies to pay off on claims like this as it is far cheaper (even at $45,000) than investigating and defending a suit. Ultimately, a southern man - particularly of a certain age - calling someone 'darling' is as much sexual harassment as Brigadier General Michael Walsh's calling Senator Barbara Boxer 'ma'am' was an attempt to somehow demean her. Ridiculous."

"In conclusion, it’s interesting to watch these self-publishers go commercial. I don’t think any of them have succeeded as much as they did with self-publishing; it’s probably because a) the process was rushed and somewhat ignored because the books already have found its audience and should therefore go on the market ASAP and b) these authors just weren’t built for commercial publication. Their books weren’t, either, which is probably why they didn’t go that route (for whatever reason) in the first place."

"The movie shoot, filmed on the Kennish property, looks pretty nifty for something thrown together in a week. Regina seems a little taken aback by the money being spent, with props, make-up, wind, and smoke machines. Daphne is also a little reserved, but it’s clear she’s noticing little things around the house that reflect the childhood she didn’t have, such as Bay and Toby’s handprints in a garden stone. Filming is set to begin, but Toby can’t figure out how to work the borrowed (from Simone/Buckner) video equipment, so Simone is brought in to shoot the movie. Emmett and Simone play off barely knowing each other, but he texts her to leave (since she doesn’t know sign). I wonder when the two exchanged phone numbers and why they programmed each other in their cells since they’re “not supposed to know each other”?"
"“In 1995, neurotoxicologist and former Director of toxicology at Forsyth Dental Center in Boston, Dr. Phyllis Mullenix published research showing that fluoride built up in the brains of animals when exposed to moderate levels. Damage to the brain occured and the behavior patterns of the animals was adversely effected. Offspring of pregnant animals receiving relatively low doses of fluoride showed permanent effects to the brain which were seen as hyperactivity (ADD-like symptoms). Young animals and adult animals given fluoride experienced the opposite effect — hypoactivity or sluggishness. The toxic effects of fluoride on the central nervous system was subsequently confirmed by previously-classified government research. Two new epidemiological studies which tend to confirm fluoride’s neurotoxic effects on the brain have shown that children exposed to higher levels of fluoride had lower IQs.”"
"Yesterday, we had a district welcome breakfast that included school mascots, four teachers singing karaoke with cardboard guitars, and two moving documentaries about our school. During those two hours, I was prouder to be a teacher at this school than I have I have ever been proud to be a part of anything. I feel so blessed to be a part of a school that is truly making a difference in students' lives. Making a difference in concrete ways. Making a difference by having a garage sale to earn money to buy two seniors laptops for college. Making a difference by opening the doors to their houses at 10pm to help a student with scholarship essays. Making a difference by demanding excellence because failure is not an option. Making a difference by helping students not just to dream, but to DO. I have some big shoes to fill."

"Recently the possibility of introducing a basic income into South Africa has come up for discussion in a number of research, labour and civil society sources. The idea of a basic income paid to all citizens was raised in 1990 by Leon Louw of the Free Market Foundation in the book Economic Alternatives edited by McGregor (1990). The present author also carried out some unpublished research on the impact of a basic income on the economy on the basis of a social accounting matrix and published some ideas on the basic incomes in the press (Roukens de Lange, 1991). Jeremy Baskin of the Department of Manpower also raised the issue in the press (1993)."

It could mean you are similarly dealing with old issues with close friends as well. Whatever the case, all this stuff is back on your plate again. Oy! The downside of Mercury is feeling frustrated with delays. But the upside of Mercury (and incredibly, there is an upside) is that you can quite easily expedite things or finish things or bring them to a conclusion now. Wouldn't it be nice to get rid of this once and for all? Some of you, however, are not dealing with old issues. You're just running into ex-partners -- and all that that implies. (Yikes!)"

Ranging from board meetings to retail store queues, you have to pretend that you subscribe to the new 'moral' order. The notion is that whites have never suffered and that they cannot be victims. Instead, whites are commonly portrayed as the authors of suffering and hardship. This politically correct dogma has turned into an unprecedented form of Orwellian Thought Policing, not even experienced under apartheid."

Of course the first thing I did, after shakily receiving J.’s reassurances that “If anyone can do this, you can,” was hit the grocery store near my office on lunch break so I could stock up on a handful of items to make the first week easier. Almond milk – check. Gluten-free pancake mix, for emergencies – check. Organic popcorn crisps for a school snack – check. And, to be completely honest, a box of Rice Chex cereal. No, ordinarily, I don’t buy boxed cereals for the boys. And I’m not sure how proud I am of the purchase. But I knew L. was familiar with Chex from school and elsewhere, and it made me feel better to pick up something that would seem sort of normal to him while I was feeling food-haywire."

If your client manages projects through Ouija boards and crayons, then so do you. We must learn to adapt and apply what we’ve learned as project managers to each client and each situation. As PM’s, we should never force feed. We must suggest, nurture, cajole – introduce slowly the project management concepts we know and love – and are enablers of success!.

A man may be amused by the coquettish impertinences of a girl, he may even be attracted by it to a certain extent, but in the end he feels repulsion, and unless it be the exception that proves the rule, hastens away presently to lay his name and fortune at the disposal of some more modest girl."
"In the New Testament, the word used for “spirit” is pneuma; however, Paul in First Corinthians 15:44 used the words: soma pneuma (“σωμα πνευματικον”) which means “spiritual body”. This is the type of body that we, as believers in Jesus, will also be raised with. A week after Jesus had resurrected, Scripture says he was still around for at least one week before his ascension (John 20:26). The resurrected Jesus walked around, made himself known to many people, and he showed himself in a resurrected spiritual-physical body to over 500 people. He was definitely not in hiding. The bible is clear about the form of Jesus’ resurrected body. The onus is on doubters to disprove that Jesus resurrected in a physical-spiritual body."

"The negativity that results from this line of argument can be qualified by way of Noys’ excellent introduction, which describes affirmationism’s emergence from two prior theoretical trends. The first of these trends is a nihilistic, post-1968 tendency to align emancipatory potential with the unleashing of capital flows (linked to the early 1970′s work of Baudrillard, Deleuze and Lyotard); but having been rendered untenable by the realities of 1980′s neo-liberalism, this is said to have given rise to a subsequent interest in linking opposition to transcendence, difference, and otherness. Affirmationism’s concerns with immanent, but also oppositional forms synthesised these two tendencies, and Noys shares its consequent avoidance of associating oppositional negativity with either immanence or transcendence: he contends that a focus on the generation of immanent difference would echo the operation of real abstraction, whilst transcendent externality mirrors the ‘void’ of abstract value itself. His account of negativity as ‘immanent rupture’ (17) is not associated with either pole: it is ‘internal’ (128) to the positivity that it contests, but it exists in a ‘relation of rupture’ (172) with it."

Manufacturers build the parts, and companies such as IBM, Acer and Dell put them together to make your ""name-brand"" PC - complete with trademark software (most likely Microsoft)."
"This man choose to starve himself - and I have felt all along that is his option. We did not deny him food. That was always his option - his treatment was always better than what Gilad received and still he complained. And worse, the Israeli government has caved in.

"The honest answer is; apart from the web, we’re not entirely sure how we’re going to do this yet.

"The culturing of meditation into our system is normal. Some people call it the higher state of consciousness, I call it the normal state of consciousness since we are endowed with the ability to live in that state. Meditation helps in two ways-it prevents stress from getting into the system and simultaneously helps release already accumulated stress. Regular meditation also leads to happiness and fulfillment; to sensitisation of the sensory organs (thereby intensifying the experiences of seeing, tasting, feeling, etc.); and to greater intuitiveness."
"Significant signings? Let’s start with the JUCOs. The top-rated junior-college player in the country is now a Tennessee Volunteer. Wide receiver Cordarrelle Patterson is a player of a position that is potentially an embarrassment of riches for the Vols. Patterson is one of four 4-star WRs coming in. Another is the best WR recruit out of Georgia — Jason Croom. Alton “Pig” Howard is another tasty WR signee for at least his name alone. Is Wide Receiver U back? The two other JUCOs are defensive linemen, a position that needs some experience right away. All three of the JUCOs can step in and be expected to contribute immediately."
"As a runner, I am the same way. When things are going well and I am oh so happy about life, I do not run as fast and I do not push myself. I just jog along in la-la land noticing the flowers and birds chirping. I have trouble pushing myself to run hard and would rather lay in the grass making flower crowns for my head and do some cartwheels while I am at it."
"2. Find a flesh and blood group of peers who you can dialog with. I prefer faith communities. Though not without their perils, they assume deeper meaning in the universe and attempt to process the challenges of living through that understanding. This lends itself to hope, and perseverance. Sometimes—especially in the storm, that is everything you need to make it through. You don’t need to agree with everything they say or think or do. You simply need them. Go out, meet your neighbors, invest at a local club, try a church or synagogue or mosque. Find fellowship with those around you."
"My life transition? This year I’ve taken a new job in a new state. It means a big transition for me but it forces my brother into a transition as well.

After the US invasion, the Sunnis were the most active guerrillas fighting the US presence in country, but recently they were literally paid off using US taxpayer money.

It worked... somewhat (Americans are of course still targeted, because they are occupying a foreign country etc)."
"Of course, most practising vampires drain the life from an unblood once in a while, but most make sure they have a careful balance between kills and the safer consumption of vampire blood. After all, in terms of quality the taste of vampire blood is generally more satisfying, more complex and bolder in its flavour than that of a normal, unconverted human being. And the most delicious blood of all, the Pinot Rouge every blood lover knows is the best on offer, is the blood taken from someone’s veins the moment after conversion."

"Everyday we are bombarded with images of beautiful woman and if you like me, it’s hard not to compare yourself. Don’t we all want to be as beautiful as the women on the magazines? According to Jezebel, a nonprofit has found that U.S. women spend $7 billion a year on cosmetics and beauty products: An average of about $100 a month each and I know there have been a few months when I’ve hit that $100 mark. Why do we spend so much? Well many of us, myself included, may have unrealistic expectations. We buy products hoping for results that aren’t possible in an effort to look like people who don’t even look like themselves! Check out the photos below and you will see the transformations a face can go through because of anything from makeup to plastic surgery."

"ONCE UPON A TIME, a little boy with a big sword went into battle against Mister Rogers. Or maybe, if the truth be told, Mister Rogers went into battle against a little boy with a big sword, for Mister Rogers didn’t like the big sword. It was one of those swords that really isn’t a sword at all; it was a big plastic contraption with lights and sound effects, and it was the kind of sword used in defense of the universe by the heroes of the television shows that the little boy liked to watch. The little boy with the big sword did not watch Mister Rogers. In fact, the little boy with the big sword didn’t know who Mister Rogers was, and so when Mister Rogers knelt down in front of him, the little boy with the big sword looked past him and through him, and when Mister Rogers said, “Oh, my; that’s a big sword you have,” the boy didn’t answer, and finally his mother got embarrassed and said, “Oh, honey, c’mon, that’s Mister Rogers,” and felt his head for fever. Of course, she knew who Mister Rogers was, because she had grown up with him, and she knew that he was good for her son, and so now, with her little boy zombie-eyed under his blond bangs, she apologized, saying to Mister Rogers that she knew he was in a rush and that she knew he was here in Penn Station taping his program and that her son usually wasn’t like this, he was probably just tired …. Except that Mister Rogers wasn’t going anywhere. Yes, sure, he was taping, and right there, in Penn Station in New York City, were throngs of other children wiggling in wait for him, but right now his patient gray eyes were fixed on the little boy with the big sword, and so he stayed there, on one knee, until the little boy’s eyes finally focused on Mister Rogers, and he said, “It’s not a sword; it’s a death ray.” A death ray! Oh, honey, Mommy knew you could do it …. And so now, encouraged, Mommy said, “Do you want to give Mister Rogers a hug, honey?” But the boy was shaking his head no, and Mister Rogers was sneaking his face past the big sword and the armor of the little boy’s eyes and whispering something in his ear–something that, while not changing his mind about the hug, made the little boy look at Mister Rogers in a new way, with the eyes of a child at last, and nod his head yes."

"One hundred years ago, 'wireless telegraphy' was mostly used to communicate with vessels crossing the Atlantic Ocean.

"“Two men are enemies,” the Corsican said. “They decide to kill each other. One is big. The other is small. They fight with fists. The small man cannot get near the big man. The small man is the most nimble. But the big man chases him. Eventually, he should catch him, and kill him. Now give to each man a knife. The small man is still at a disadvantage. The big man has more reach. It’s difficult to penetrate his wide guard. But the small man is the more nimble. His thrusts are the quicker. And knife-fighting is a question of courage. Perhaps the big one feels faint when he thinks he may die. Or when he sees blood. The battle is more even. It is more dirty to fight with fists than with knives. To attack another man with fists is a dirty trick, requiring little courage, but only bestial strength.” This Corsican was biased, being an expert with the knife he carried and ate and shaved with. It was a long curving blade, with a delicately curved, black bone handle, I recall. But I thoroughly agreed, and agree with his sentiments. To hell with adventure novelists who decry every man who draws a knife and lionise honest John who fights with his fists."

"This lets me have some fun 'cause all my flannels are from when I planned on cloth diapering Sunshine with some AIOs (all in ones are like washable disposable diapers with velcro tabs). We ended up using EC (Elimination Communication ) and didn't need any extra diapers so...I've a LOT of flannel. Since I'm gender neutral I picked out all the fabric I found cute. There's Bad to the Bone, Unicorns, little toadstools, Frogs, Knights with Castles, motorcycles, space, a Supergirl...just lots. I take silky ribbons that I keep every year and after 'wrapping' it like you would with paper I wrap it with the ribbon. Sometimes I'll pull it up and have this poof of fabric with a big bow. That looks nice for the solid colors. I'll take some pictures of ours to share with ya'll and hopefully you can use the idea next year. Remember...after Christmas sells!"

"Oh yeah, back to the movie, how does all this EPR rambling tie in to the movie? Well, I really wish I had seen it when Eran Kolirin was still here, because I would've loved to quiz him about it. But I can say that festival programmer Rod Armstrong introduced the movie by saying in previous Q&A's some audience members wanted to ascribe mental health issues (anything from depression to schizophrenia) to the protagonist, and Eran was adamant that he's not crazy in any way. Well, that's easy for me--he's not crazy, he's just a physicist. And his class ends one day when he's right in the middle of discussing EPR. So he goes home with all this at the front of his mind, keenly aware he's collapsing Wave Functions all around him. Well, as a guy, what's the one thing that is most profound to collapse by observing. That's right, his own penis. So he takes a second, whips it out, and looks at it in the mirror. Then he notices another guy watching him. And wacky hijinx ensue."

"Besides the health, financial, and environmental reasons, there is of course the ethical reason. Is it correct that 70 Billion animals are raised each year only to become food for humans? The vast majority of these animals live lives of such unimaginable squalor and suffering as to dull the senses. There seems to be a widespread idea that animals, for some reason, don’t feel pain or suffering like humans, or that they only exist to feed humans. These are such juvenile ideas that they would almost be laughable if they weren’t so repugnant. Notwithstanding the active abuse dished out to untold numbers of animals and the horrible conditions that they inhabit during their short, sad lives, the worst part of this issue is the fact that most humans feel that there is nothing wrong in our very mentally which justifies the slavery and subservience of all other animals to our appetites and whims, and that humans are naturally superior and ordained to dominate and rule the earth because we are the most intelligent species. This is an example of an intelligence I want no part of. We are animals too, and this slavery and abuse is unacceptable and should not be tolerated or even allowed."

"So that’s the main thing I remember about that film. And then, of course, it was a disaster when it came out - and almost immediately it also turned into a cult film – and it still is! Frankly, I don’t quite understand why – except that there’s no movie remotely like it. I saw it again a little over 10 years ago at a film festival in Dallas. They wanted me to come down because they couldn’t get anyone else so I went. And the category it was in was called “Films We Love to Hate”. And I thought wait a minute, they didn’t tell me that! And then I was interviewed in front of an audience at a midnight showing. They were asking me about Otto Preminger. And I said he was one of the great film directors and everybody laughed out loud. Then I started to list a number of movies that are remarkable and have some range. And at every one I said, they would laugh. “Wait a minute,” I said, “This is not being fair.” “Yeah, but Skidoo - we hear it’s terrible.” And I said, “Every film director who’s made a lot of movies has made a couple that don’t work – and by the way Skidoo does have a following.” So then I settled down with them to watch the film and I was like, “Oh God, it is terrible. It’s awful.” He was trying for something original and unusual – and he was challenging himself – but he didn’t know how to do it. It just wasn’t his thing."

Damage to the brain occured and the behavior patterns of the animals was adversely effected. Offspring of pregnant animals receiving relatively low doses of fluoride showed permanent effects to the brain which were seen as hyperactivity (ADD-like symptoms). Young animals and adult animals given fluoride experienced the opposite effect — hypoactivity or sluggishness. The toxic effects of fluoride on the central nervous system was subsequently confirmed by previously-classified government research. Two new epidemiological studies which tend to confirm fluoride’s neurotoxic effects on the brain have shown that children exposed to higher levels of fluoride had lower IQs.”"

The power of the film does not lie in the story line—it is undeniably a simple, predictable one. The power of the film lies in default by what the film suggests to the viewer by presenting the simple tale. Do “caring” parents really care for their children?

"These things are sometimes so intensely private and personal that outside witnesses are more intruder than observer. In fact, I know some artists who proclaim they are not even curious what anyone else thinks. Their interest extends only as far as the creative vision itself. This art is not trying to engage an audience. The truth is, creative types are often simply interested in what their imagination provides or reveals, and decidedly not always in how it gets received. Sometimes our art is so internally focused that it is at most a private conversation, and an audience is only dropping eves and in butting where they are not wanted."

"The plants need a lot of caring and nurturing for them to grow right. Watering them morning and afternoon, cultivating the soil and checking them regularly are some ways to help the plants grow. For the garden to come into completion, one should not just plant and wait doing nothing. Same is true with our lives, we all have dreams and things that we want to accomplish, but we will not see them turn into reality if we just wait and do nothing. We have to make steps for them to be fulfilled. Planning without right implementation produces nothing. Nurture and do things that add-up to the realization of the vision."

"""The object of this Essay is to assert one very simple principle, as entitled to govern absolutely the dealings of society with the individual in the way of compulsion and control, whether the means used be physical force in the form of legal penalties, or the moral coercion of public opinion. That principle is, that the sole end for which mankind are warranted, individually or collectively, in interfering with the liberty of action of any of their number, is self-protection. That the only purpose for which power can be rightfully exercised over any member of a civilised community, against his will, is to prevent harm to others. His own good, either physical or moral, is not a sufficient warrant. He cannot rightfully be compelled to do or forbear because it will be better for him to do so, because it will make him happier, because, in the opinions of others, to do so would be wise, or even right. These are good reasons for remonstrating with him, or reasoning with him, or persuading him, or entreating him, but not for compelling him, or visiting him with any evil in case he do otherwise. To justify that, the conduct from which it is desired to deter him must be calculated to produce evil to some one else. The only part of the conduct of any one, for which he is amenable to society, is that which concerns others. In the part which merely concerns himself, his independence is, of right, absolute. Over himself, over his own body and mind, the individual is sovereign."""

"Nothing spells gloom like My Dying Bride, a band that has been at the forefront of the doom metal genre since their inception in the early 90′s. Though emotionally and thematically very much in the wake of their past material, Evinta rids itself of guitars and all other typical instruments in favor of classical instruments, creating a powerful, epic, atmospheric, expansive (3-disc) ambient/neo-classical experience."
"Not that his story really needs a lot of exaggeration. He apparently faked illness to distract his guards, and escaped during the night. According to ABC News’ account, which was furnished by one of those who aided Guangcheng in his escape, he climbed a wall, swam across a river, and walked for hours before he was picked up by allies. He’s been blind since childhood, so he had develop sharp hearing, and it’s that which allowed him to navigate through the darkness that slowed his guards’ efforts to find him."
"If things were not going strange enough, last night, I got hit with malware on the computer. I was searching for some transmission drawings on the internet and hit a site that started trying to scan my computer for errors, trying to sell me data recovery software and showed all kinds of warnings. I could not close it out. I performed a virus scan and a hard drive scan. The scans made it appear that all my files were there, but I could not find anything! Most of the night, the scans ran but this morning it was no better. After returning from the dentist, I had a thought and ran a ""System Restore"" to a time before the event occurred. Sure enough the computer was restored to the configuration from the previous day. The malware was gone and all my files are back. The only thing missing is my Favorites on my browser. I need to fiqure out if those can be reloaded. I am happy this worked, I thought I was going to have to take the computer somewhere and pay to get it fixed."

"Within the last week, it came to my attention that a better source for the Soundcheck had surfaced. Listening to it, I was shocked over how much better the new source was over the muddled recording that had been floating around in the hands of collectors for 30 years. And even more interesting, the new source came from Russian with love, and not from the UK or elsewhere. Fage, a JDC member, provided the Soundcheck for this post. Of the two songs in the Soundcheck, “Ceremony” really shines. The Soundcheck is night and day to any other source, which is a testament to how talented Fage is when it comes to audio restoration."

"2) The More-Than-Obvious Scorsese Connection - It is certainly no secret that Martin Scorsese is one of the biggest influences on PTA's career, but it is more evident in Boogie Nights than anywhere else in the auteur's oeuvre, and the most obvious Scorsese-influenced connection is to the master's 1990 modern day masterpiece Goodfellas. From the rags to riches and back to rags story arc of Goodfellas' Henry Hill and Boogie Nights' Dirk Diggler to the ever-roaming, ever-moving camera of both films, the long, always-sharp-eyed tracking shots, Anderson shows his prowess as a filmmaker while also honoring his stylistic mentor with a hot-blooded homage. To watch as Wahlberg's wouldbe porn icon weaves his way through clubs and pool parties and recording studios is like watching Ray Liotta leading a wide-eyed, bewildered Lorraine Bracco through the back passages of the Copacabana in Goodfellas. Great stuff indeed."

"Maki takes a job at a small company that gives tourists hour-long joy rides on a Cessna. It’s not like piloting fighter jets. But the steady hours mean he gets more time to be near his son. On his first day a strange woman in black, Sara, signs up for a ride and holds Maki at gunpoint, ordering him to fly far off his usual course. The mysterious hijacker takes him to a secret military base where Maki is quarantined in a huge concrete reinforced bunker. His demands to know why are met with stoic silence. Finally, once Maki is securely locked into the bunker’s basement under guard and unable to escape, he is told the answer."

"It is cut small, so that it doesn’t lace up all the way. That way there is a gap in the front for the heart to show though to the skin. I just used one lace to keep the top up, the heart sits just under it. I used a corset because it gives a lot of support with no shoulder straps, which would spoil the look of the Morrigan costume. Things to be aware of when making or buying a corset for this part… make sure the bottom of the corset doesn’t poke out through the leg openings, and the top goes under the top of the bodysuit in the back. The corset also gives great boob support! Here is what it looks like under the bodysuit –"

"Oh yeah, back to the movie, how does all this EPR rambling tie in to the movie? Well, I really wish I had seen it when Eran Kolirin was still here, because I would've loved to quiz him about it. But I can say that festival programmer Rod Armstrong introduced the movie by saying in previous Q&A's some audience members wanted to ascribe mental health issues (anything from depression to schizophrenia) to the protagonist, and Eran was adamant that he's not crazy in any way. Well, that's easy for me--he's not crazy, he's just a physicist. And his class ends one day when he's right in the middle of discussing EPR. So he goes home with all this at the front of his mind, keenly aware he's collapsing Wave Functions all around him. Well, as a guy, what's the one thing that is most profound to collapse by observing. That's right, his own penis. So he takes a second, whips it out, and looks at it in the mirror. Then he notices another guy watching him. And wacky hijinx ensue."

It was actually great - although old, the equipment seemed quite well maintained, and it was excellent to see some of those old styles of activities - giant see-saws (I went on one and was quite freaked out - now that I comprehend danger to a greater extent it is far more exhilarating!) a double slide, those twirly cups you sit in, and a menagerie of bouncy animals."

"In this respect, sinister role of Indian RAW could also be judged from some other events of sectarian violence. In 2008, in Khyber Agency, intermittent fighting between Lashkar-e-Islam and Ansar-ul-Islam had claimed as many as 1500 lives. Lashkar Islami is led by fanatic cleric Mangal Bagh who follows the puritanical Deobandi form of Sunni Islam and has close connections with the extremist Taliban of Afghanistan. Besides other areas of Pakistan, more than 2000 people died in sectarian riots in Kurram Agency, bordering Afghanistan. Its areas have been hit by fierce clashes, pitching Sunni Muslims against the minority Shias. A number of ceasefires was concluded between the warring sects with the help of government officials and the tribal Maliks, but the same proved fruitless owing to the support from Afghanistan where more than hundred training centers covertly established by RAW are supervising anti-Pakistan activities with the tactical help CIA and Mossad."

But perhaps they do have their uses. Macabre as is sounds, they helped Thomas, and Jesus offered him exactly what he wanted – to put his hand in his nail marks and in his side. Perhaps, believing in the resurrection, even our scars become part of our sending."

"I’m sure none of you have ever heard of this movie or that even if you have, you most likely did not bother to watch it. As for me, whenever Vampires are the main characters of movies or novels I tend to get curious and want to know what it is all about. I was actually about to watch the Vampire Diaries Season 3 Ep 20 but this movie’s title caught my attention and I just had to check it out. I would have been so happy if it had been up to my expectations and even above but it wasn’t.

"Oh yeah, back to the movie, how does all this EPR rambling tie in to the movie? Well, I really wish I had seen it when Eran Kolirin was still here, because I would've loved to quiz him about it. But I can say that festival programmer Rod Armstrong introduced the movie by saying in previous Q&A's some audience members wanted to ascribe mental health issues (anything from depression to schizophrenia) to the protagonist, and Eran was adamant that he's not crazy in any way. Well, that's easy for me--he's not crazy, he's just a physicist. And his class ends one day when he's right in the middle of discussing EPR. So he goes home with all this at the front of his mind, keenly aware he's collapsing Wave Functions all around him. Well, as a guy, what's the one thing that is most profound to collapse by observing. That's right, his own penis. So he takes a second, whips it out, and looks at it in the mirror. Then he notices another guy watching him. And wacky hijinx ensue."

"The leg movement, colloquially known as the “frog kick” or “whip kick”, consists of two phases: bringing the feet into position for the thrust phase and the insweep phase. From the initial position with the legs stretched out backward, the feet are moved together towards the posterior, while the knees stay together. The knees should not sink too low, as this increases the drag. Then the feet point outward in preparation for the thrust phase. In the thrust phase, the legs are moved elliptically back to the initial position. During this movement, the knees are kept together. The legs move slower while bringing the legs into position for the thrust phase, and move very fast during the thrust phase. Again, the goal is produce maximum thrust during the in sweep phase, and minimum drag during the recovery phase. In the recovery phase the lower leg and the feet are in the wake of the upper leg, and the feet are pointed to the rear. In the thrust phase all three parts create their own wake, and the flat end of the feet acts like a hydrofoil aligned to give maximum forward thrust. The resulting drag coefficient (or more precisely the frontal area) is thus doubled in the thrust phase."

Fredericksburg is called the same by both north and south."
"What unfortunately follows is – with the software application acting as a security blanket of project management commitment – true PM techniques and principles are often never learned (nor the application, mind you). Firms utilize the “accidental project management” approach, throw a few activities into an .mpp file, and focus much of their effort on the maximizing the practice of “project management by powerpoint” As a consultant, the most important thing to remember is this – Project Management is in the eye of the beholder (no matter what PMI or PRINCE2 or any other BOK may say.) If your client manages projects through Ouija boards and crayons, then so do you. We must learn to adapt and apply what we’ve learned as project managers to each client and each situation. As PM’s, we should never force feed. We must suggest, nurture, cajole – introduce slowly the project management concepts we know and love – and are enablers of success!.

"Christians need to start taking a long, painful look at their use of power in the culture and in the Church. Jesus commanded his disciples specifically to not utilize power like the unbelieving world. The fact that Jesus’ coronation ceremony was his beating and crucifixion and that he commands us to take up our cross to follow him points towards the necessity of laying down power, rights and claims to temporal self-justice for something greater. But with the acceptance of cultural norms regarding power, wealth and celebrity (the unholy trinity of American secular religion) into the Church, we are becoming a joke, a punch line and cliché to the dying world in need of a witness for another way."

"In the New Testament, the word used for “spirit” is pneuma; however, Paul in First Corinthians 15:44 used the words: soma pneuma (“σωμα πνευματικον”) which means “spiritual body”. This is the type of body that we, as believers in Jesus, will also be raised with. A week after Jesus had resurrected, Scripture says he was still around for at least one week before his ascension (John 20:26). The resurrected Jesus walked around, made himself known to many people, and he showed himself in a resurrected spiritual-physical body to over 500 people. He was definitely not in hiding. The bible is clear about the form of Jesus’ resurrected body. The onus is on doubters to disprove that Jesus resurrected in a physical-spiritual body."

When you find yourself in a tailspin of procrastination and distraction, the best thing that you can do is stop, go back to the productivity dashboard, dump all the things that are swimming around in your head, and refocus your efforts by blocking out time to accomplish your most valued priorities."

"So, first up, these three books came from The Works on Tuesday. ""But Ellie, didst thou not already pillage Ye Olde Works of Yonder Town last week?"" I hear you cry. Well, yes, but this was a different store with different stock, and I was hurting after my first physiotherapy appointment. I also came home with a bundle of super-nostalgic sweets from the old-fashioned sweet emporium, so you can see what kind of mood I was in. Anyway, Arlene Russo's The Real Twilight: True Stories of Modern Day Vampires was the first book I saw, and for £1.99 I thought it might be interesting to see just how far weird vamp-obsession can go. Cash, Johnny Cash's famous autobiography, was tucked under a heap of other books so I plucked that out as well. And just as we were about to leave, I spotted a hardcover copy of Karl Pilkington's An Idiot Abroad hidden behind a big display. I think he's hilarious but his books are usually so darn expensive, so £4.99 seemed a pretty good deal!"

"The second speaker was our teacher and great trend watcher, Vincent Albers. He told us about cultural indicators. Cultural indicators can help you choose the best fitting business strategy or creating campaigns for certain target groups. Every culture has it’s own habits and values, for example, in the one culture individualism stands for success and in the other culture it stands for someone who is selfish. To measure some of these important cultural habits there are ‘the five cultural dimensions’: Power Distance Index, Individualism, Masculinity, Uncertainty Avoidance Index and the Long-Term Orientation. On the website www.geert-hofstede.com you can see the score of the five cultural indicators for different countries with an explanation below."

To live and work for what looked like at least ten years. Never before in my life had I had a prayer answered. Whats more, I don’t think I wound up in Hawai’i just because its GREEN, I think it was because of Aloha, and how I needed that to help heal my soul too. I know there is two parts to every equation and that I must learn what Hawai’i needs from me as well, and I am learning, but for me Aloha is an answer to a much deeper and more profoundly impactful question, “how do we heal the sickness that is ravaging our world?” The same sickness of people using each other that I escaped from in Vegas and is spreading across the world, I honestly believe the answer is Aloha. I already love this place, and I wound up here for a reason, I’m not an invader, but want to help defend it, and spread its medicine."

"The culturing of meditation into our system is normal. Some people call it the higher state of consciousness, I call it the normal state of consciousness since we are endowed with the ability to live in that state. Meditation helps in two ways-it prevents stress from getting into the system and simultaneously helps release already accumulated stress. Regular meditation also leads to happiness and fulfillment; to sensitisation of the sensory organs (thereby intensifying the experiences of seeing, tasting, feeling, etc.); and to greater intuitiveness."

"“In 1995, neurotoxicologist and former Director of toxicology at Forsyth Dental Center in Boston, Dr. Phyllis Mullenix published research showing that fluoride built up in the brains of animals when exposed to moderate levels. Damage to the brain occured and the behavior patterns of the animals was adversely effected. Offspring of pregnant animals receiving relatively low doses of fluoride showed permanent effects to the brain which were seen as hyperactivity (ADD-like symptoms). Young animals and adult animals given fluoride experienced the opposite effect — hypoactivity or sluggishness. The toxic effects of fluoride on the central nervous system was subsequently confirmed by previously-classified government research. Two new epidemiological studies which tend to confirm fluoride’s neurotoxic effects on the brain have shown that children exposed to higher levels of fluoride had lower IQs.”"
"When I was growing up this was a very common dish in my house. My Mom would make this super-simple fried tofu at least twice a week as a snack, an appetizer, or a side dish in a larger Asian-style meal. When I visit my mother in Atlanta we eat it at every evening meal. We’ve been eating this same tofu dish for years and years because it is utterly delicious and surprisingly addictive. The mild curd develops unexpected flavors (sweet, a little sour, a little nutty) when fried, and the crisp edges give it textural interest and a nice chew. Dipped in something as simple as soy sauce, maybe with a little fiery chili paste in it, the little soy bean curd pillows are delightfully fun to eat as you pop them in your mouth. When I married Regina I discovered that she too loves this dish, which made me realize anew that fried tofu is ubiquitous in Asia. Fried tofu eclipses class and culture and politics — pretty much everyone who eats it loves it. Certainly my whole family loves it, including my tofu-obsessed father and my eight-year old son Bennet."

"She was breathing deeply, she forgot the cold, the weight of beings, the insane static life, the lone languish of living or dying. After so many years running from fear, fleeing crazily, uselessly, she was finally coming to a halt. At the same time she seemed to be recovering her roots, and the sap rose anew in her body, which was no longer trembling. Pressing her whole body against the parapet, leaning toward the wheeling sky, she was only waiting for her pounding heart to settle down, and for the silence to form in her. The last constellations of stars fell in bunches a little lower on the horizon of the desert, and stood motionless. Then, with an unbearable sweetness, the waters of the night began to fill her, submerging the cold, rising, gradually to the center of her being, and overflowing wave upon wave to her moaning mouth. A moment later, the whole sky stretched out above her as she lay with her back against the cold earth."

After twelve years, Hans knows very little about himself, except that he does not want to be a grave robber. On the other hand, Angela, the twelve-year-old daughter of the Count and Countess von Schwanenberg knows that she wants to write and perform her marionette plays in all the courts of Europe.

"Yes, I know smoking was bad for me, and that I gave up before the hacking cough and health problems kicked in. I gave up before I reached 40, so I remember all the pleasure cigarettes give the young but none of the downsides, which show themselves later on in life. However, for all the wonders of the world He created, it is surely evidence of a somewhat perverse sense of humour on the part of the maker that so much in life which gives you pleasure, is either bad for you, or makes you fat. There are surely few experiences more dismal than an entirely healthy lifestyle, and that seems rather unfair."
"Over the past decade a host of books have been published on the differences between the generations of workers, with labels like Baby Boomers, Gen X, Gen Y, Millennials and so on. As you read books like The 2020 Workplace, Bridging the Boomer-Xer Gap, Generations at Work and similar titles, the authors use the differences between the generations to talk about their skills and weaknesses as groups, and how to take advantage of the skills and overcome the weaknesses."

"Michelle Williams was also nominated, and she showed up in a very demure, beaded Chanel Haute Couture dress. I am not a fan of the top half, as it is a little too T-shirty. That would have worked on someone a lot older. Someone with bingowings and saggy boobs."

"Everyday"
"Everyday we are bombarded with images of beautiful woman and if you like me, it’s hard not to compare yourself. Don’t we all want to be as beautiful as the women on the magazines? According to Jezebel, a nonprofit has found that U.S. women spend $7 billion a year on cosmetics and beauty products: An average of about $100 a month each and I know there have been a few months when I’ve hit that $100 mark. Why do we spend so much? Well many of us, myself included, may have unrealistic expectations. We buy products hoping for results that aren’t possible in an effort to look like people who don’t even look like themselves! Check out the photos below and you will see the transformations a face can go through because of anything from makeup to plastic surgery."

"I had absolutely no shame in cheating in GTAIII. Instantly getting the fuzz off my back after going on a killing spree was such a relief. The no wanted level cheat was probably the first among GTA cheats that I memorized. And the weapons cheat. Ohhhh, the weapons cheat. Shooting people with a pistol is alright. Burning them to a crisp with the flame thrower, blowing them up with a rocket launcher? AWESOME. The rocket launcher was especially delightful to use. At times I would find some high ground and start shooting people and nuking cars. When the cops brought out a helicopter, I'd just take aim and it was down in a matter of seconds. But the granddaddy of all cheats would have to be spawning a tank. Talk about power. The tank was nigh unstoppable. Any car it touched was instantly blown up, which made me laugh like a madman every time police cars would try to stop me. The tank has never been as strong in a GTA game as it has in GTAIII, able to take a sizable amount of punishment before you can't use it anymore. As a result, it isn't as fun to use in later installments. A shame, really."

"It’s no secret that I’m sick. I have been for about 3 weeks and some change. Whether it’s allergies or something horrifying like walking pneumonia or mono (thank you, WebMD), I don’t know. It doesn’t help that sleeping through the night is a myth to me. You’d think I was a newborn baby or something but it certainly isn’t ME that isn’t capable of sleeping through the night.

"Needless to say, friends, the dream rattled me. It's played in my head at least twice this month, and each time, I've jolted awake with a feeling of panic. I've never blamed myself for my father's death. In fact, no one in my family has ever blamed themselves -- something I've always been so thankful for since playing the blame game is all too common when a loved one commits suicide. But each time I woke up, I felt the sting of those feelings..."

"In the spirit of men like Bob Geldof feeding the starving, I feel us as a community ought to come to the aid of our Belgian brothers in their hour of need. I propose a grog whip round to be sent to Belgium. Any spare grog, whether lout or pongy ale can be sent to me and I’ll make sure it gets to Belgium. Rest assured the grog will not just sit in my fridge and be necked whilst I lounge on the couch farting and watching documentaries on channel four about fat kids, and laughing my head off when they run. Of course I’ll have to check the grog for quality control purposes, but the Belgians will be welcome to come and pick up their grog any time they like."
"We spent Thursday hanging out at Mom’s, enjoyed a majorly awesome meal (where Jeremy and Grandpa split turkey carving duty), and then began the trek back to Kalamazoo. We got home at about 11 PM and set to unloading. Not the most ideal time to unload but since the truck was due back at 2 pm and I had to work Black Friday from 7 a.m. – 3 p.m. at Bath & Body Works… there weren’t many other options."
"So I wasn't surprised when I got up early that Sunday morning to drive home that there was fog. Fog is a part of living in the valley ... especially when the temperatures warm up during the day and get down into freezing temperatures at night. The fog, known as tule fog, can be so thick that there can be zero visibility. They even close the schools on those thick fog days."

And very easy to put into place, plus giving me the opportunity to make it look prettier. Sometimes, even if it works fine, if it's ugly I hate it. I have to look at it all the time.

"Pierre and I talked about plans for the children. He said their building was basically untouched but they were afraid to put the children back in as aftershocks continue to periodically hit the city. He was also concerned about food, water, and safety…the same things everyone else is struggling with at this moment. After our talk I drove around the city searching for large bags of water I could bring the kids. After an hour of driving I returned with 80 tiny bags of water. It was all I could find, but it was completely insufficient for the 175 or so children and workers."

"As to the names issue, the North tended to call battles and armies after bodies of water, and the South would pick the nearest town or other man-made feature in selecting names, so Manassas Junction was what they called the battle of Bull Run after, and this trend then continued on with many other battles. Fredericksburg is called the same by both north and south."
"Some accounts have McClellan ardently opposed to this new medium on those grounds.

(Something Tammany candidates aren't exactly known for.)"

"She was breathing deeply, she forgot the cold, the weight of beings, the insane static life, the lone languish of living or dying. After so many years running from fear, fleeing crazily, uselessly, she was finally coming to a halt. At the same time she seemed to be recovering her roots, and the sap rose anew in her body, which was no longer trembling. Pressing her whole body against the parapet, leaning toward the wheeling sky, she was only waiting for her pounding heart to settle down, and for the silence to form in her. The last constellations of stars fell in bunches a little lower on the horizon of the desert, and stood motionless. Then, with an unbearable sweetness, the waters of the night began to fill her, submerging the cold, rising, gradually to the center of her being, and overflowing wave upon wave to her moaning mouth. A moment later, the whole sky stretched out above her as she lay with her back against the cold earth."

"The negativity that results from this line of argument can be qualified by way of Noys’ excellent introduction, which describes affirmationism’s emergence from two prior theoretical trends. The first of these trends is a nihilistic, post-1968 tendency to align emancipatory potential with the unleashing of capital flows (linked to the early 1970′s work of Baudrillard, Deleuze and Lyotard); but having been rendered untenable by the realities of 1980′s neo-liberalism, this is said to have given rise to a subsequent interest in linking opposition to transcendence, difference, and otherness. Affirmationism’s concerns with immanent, but also oppositional forms synthesised these two tendencies, and Noys shares its consequent avoidance of associating oppositional negativity with either immanence or transcendence: he contends that a focus on the generation of immanent difference would echo the operation of real abstraction, whilst transcendent externality mirrors the ‘void’ of abstract value itself. His account of negativity as ‘immanent rupture’ (17) is not associated with either pole: it is ‘internal’ (128) to the positivity that it contests, but it exists in a ‘relation of rupture’ (172) with it."
"My life transition? This year I’ve taken a new job in a new state. It means a big transition for me but it forces my brother into a transition as well.

"Of course, most practising vampires drain the life from an unblood once in a while, but most make sure they have a careful balance between kills and the safer consumption of vampire blood. After all, in terms of quality the taste of vampire blood is generally more satisfying, more complex and bolder in its flavour than that of a normal, unconverted human being. And the most delicious blood of all, the Pinot Rouge every blood lover knows is the best on offer, is the blood taken from someone’s veins the moment after conversion."

"I did my workout shortly after getting home. Today was Cardio Axe and Tummy Tuck. So, cardio and ab work. I've done both of these before, but not for several months. I forgot how much fun the dancing in Cardio Axe is! I just love it, and I continue to love Leandro's fun, vibrant personality. The only complaint I have with this workout is I would like it to be a little longer and/or a little more intense. It does make me sweat, but not as much as a lot of my other cardio DVDs. As for Tummy Tuck, I now remember why it's been so long since I've done this one. The routine is very good, and I'm sure it will give me nice abs, but I just don't like it very much. It involves a lot of crunches, which I'm not a big fan of (neck straining galore), and a lot of plank work. Which I actually do like, but not for about five minutes total. My shoulders are just screaming at me by the end, to the point where I can't focus on the actual ab work that's being done. I much prefer the Ab Jam routine from Turbo Jam or a couple other DVDs that I have. But it's all good. I will do that workout when I need to and completely love the rest of the program."
"She was breathing deeply, she forgot the cold, the weight of beings, the insane static life, the lone languish of living or dying. After so many years running from fear, fleeing crazily, uselessly, she was finally coming to a halt. At the same time she seemed to be recovering her roots, and the sap rose anew in her body, which was no longer trembling. Pressing her whole body against the parapet, leaning toward the wheeling sky, she was only waiting for her pounding heart to settle down, and for the silence to form in her. The last constellations of stars fell in bunches a little lower on the horizon of the desert, and stood motionless. Then, with an unbearable sweetness, the waters of the night began to fill her, submerging the cold, rising, gradually to the center of her being, and overflowing wave upon wave to her moaning mouth. A moment later, the whole sky stretched out above her as she lay with her back against the cold earth."

Sobran's terror was so great that he was calm, a serenity like that a missionary priest had reported having felt when he found himself briefly in the jaws of a lion.

In 2008, in Khyber Agency, intermittent fighting between Lashkar-e-Islam and Ansar-ul-Islam had claimed as many as 1500 lives. Lashkar Islami is led by fanatic cleric Mangal Bagh who follows the puritanical Deobandi form of Sunni Islam and has close connections with the extremist Taliban of Afghanistan. Besides other areas of Pakistan, more than 2000 people died in sectarian riots in Kurram Agency, bordering Afghanistan. Its areas have been hit by fierce clashes, pitching Sunni Muslims against the minority Shias. A number of ceasefires was concluded between the warring sects with the help of government officials and the tribal Maliks, but the same proved fruitless owing to the support from Afghanistan where more than hundred training centers covertly established by RAW are supervising anti-Pakistan activities with the tactical help CIA and Mossad."

With Egypt moving towards the Soviet sphere of influence, the United States took advantage of Ethiopia’s reaction to the NWA by proposing a study of the development of the upstream Nile waters in Ethiopia. By 1964 the US Bureau of Reclamation had produced the Blue Nile Waters Study, which included proposals for a series of huge dams and irrigation schemes in Ethiopia. These projects never came to fruition, yet helped to stoke Egyptian fears surrounding the actions of upstream riparians."

"""The object of this Essay is to assert one very simple principle, as entitled to govern absolutely the dealings of society with the individual in the way of compulsion and control, whether the means used be physical force in the form of legal penalties, or the moral coercion of public opinion. That principle is, that the sole end for which mankind are warranted, individually or collectively, in interfering with the liberty of action of any of their number, is self-protection. That the only purpose for which power can be rightfully exercised over any member of a civilised community, against his will, is to prevent harm to others. His own good, either physical or moral, is not a sufficient warrant. He cannot rightfully be compelled to do or forbear because it will be better for him to do so, because it will make him happier, because, in the opinions of others, to do so would be wise, or even right. These are good reasons for remonstrating with him, or reasoning with him, or persuading him, or entreating him, but not for compelling him, or visiting him with any evil in case he do otherwise. To justify that, the conduct from which it is desired to deter him must be calculated to produce evil to some one else. The only part of the conduct of any one, for which he is amenable to society, is that which concerns others. In the part which merely concerns himself, his independence is, of right, absolute. Over himself, over his own body and mind, the individual is sovereign."""

"Needless to say, friends, the dream rattled me. It's played in my head at least twice this month, and each time, I've jolted awake with a feeling of panic. I've never blamed myself for my father's death. In fact, no one in my family has ever blamed themselves -- something I've always been so thankful for since playing the blame game is all too common when a loved one commits suicide. But each time I woke up, I felt the sting of those feelings..."

David wasn’t some casual fling for Victoria – he was the big deal and I mean that in the way that Dominik certainly isn’t and given that Conrad resorted to underhanded tactics to get rid of Dominik, having David killed doesn’t seem all that shocking to be honest."

"I’ve written extensively about ways to restrain the economic power of the wealthy, which largely point to making our tax system more progressive and harder to evade, eliminating corporate welfare, and regulating financial capital to the point where it’s “safe, stable, and boring.” One rare area where there is widespread popular support for progressive causes is tax fairness – witness the popularity of the “Buffett Rule” in the U.S, the unpopularity of Chancellor Osborne’s decision to lower the top income bracket in the U.K, and Hollande of the French Socialists staking his platform on a top tax rate of 75% on the wealthiest."

"“In 1995, neurotoxicologist and former Director of toxicology at Forsyth Dental Center in Boston, Dr. Phyllis Mullenix published research showing that fluoride built up in the brains of animals when exposed to moderate levels. Damage to the brain occured and the behavior patterns of the animals was adversely effected. Offspring of pregnant animals receiving relatively low doses of fluoride showed permanent effects to the brain which were seen as hyperactivity (ADD-like symptoms). Young animals and adult animals given fluoride experienced the opposite effect — hypoactivity or sluggishness. The toxic effects of fluoride on the central nervous system was subsequently confirmed by previously-classified government research. Two new epidemiological studies which tend to confirm fluoride’s neurotoxic effects on the brain have shown that children exposed to higher levels of fluoride had lower IQs.”"

"A strange thing happened to me in between the first season of Laid and this second season premiere – I grew fonder of the show. This doesn’t mean my opinion of the first season changed; I still think of it as a drippy, one-note, trying-too-hard dramedy, but I did find myself strangely looking forward to the new season because of two key cast members. Let’s place the blame for this at the feet of The Little Dum Dum Club, a hilarious podcast hosted by Karl Chandler and Tommy Dassalo where each episode they invite a comic into the studio for a chat. Celia Pacquola has been on the show once by herself and once with her boyfriend, and Laid co-star, Toby Truslove and both of them were very funny and delightful and I liked them so much I was half-convinced the second season of Laid might be better. While this episode doesn’t come across as self-satisfied as the show did in its first season, a lot of the things that didn’t work the first time around still don’t work the second time around."

The Proposals emphasize the importance of invention and creativeness, both of which are said to be essential for China's continued economic success. Special mention was given to the role of independent innovation, especially in core and common technologies, to help promote scientific and technological breakthrough. The Chinese, taking a leaf from the USA and some other developed jurisdictions, also plan to make the machinery of enterprise run more smoothly by fostering market and industry–research–university partnerships."

No, ordinarily, I don’t buy boxed cereals for the boys. And I’m not sure how proud I am of the purchase.

Susan has admitted she’s not afraid of taking chances any longer because of her stay in Italy. I would love to be that brave and strong!"
"""Nobody wants to give books to a writer,"" a relative told me. ""It would be like we were setting up unreasonably high bar for your book."" And then, I swear to god, he patted me on the head. Which, for those of you watching at home, is how Midwesterners participate in the soft tyranny of low expectations. (Also, I would like to say yet another prayer of thanksgiving that none of my relatives know how to work the internet.)"

"26. I got the funniest e-mail from my cousin. She told me that Saturday all women were to run through the streets naked to help weed out the terrorists. You know that it is a sin for Muslim males to see any woman other than his wife naked and if he does he HAS to commit suicide!! And by the way....the government appreciates your efforts to rid of these terrorist!! HEHE...."
"Needless to say, friends, the dream rattled me. It's played in my head at least twice this month, and each time, I've jolted awake with a feeling of panic. I've never blamed myself for my father's death. In fact, no one in my family has ever blamed themselves -- something I've always been so thankful for since playing the blame game is all too common when a loved one commits suicide. But each time I woke up, I felt the sting of those feelings..."
"Adoption specialists point out that adoptees often feel anger in response to being given away by birth parents, feeling like second class citizens, and feeling unworthy of having anything good happen to them. We must also stay mindful of the fact that many adoptees come from backgrounds where there is a family history of poor impulse control, psychiatric disorders, substance abuse, or other factors that can contribute to a poor modulation of emotions. Thus, when the child is angry, he may have little recognition or control over how intense his response is. Also, children who grew up in violent or chaotic environments had aggression and rage modeled for them and they quickly learn that it is an effective way of getting attention and perhaps even getting one’s needs met."

"Many of us think of name brands such as Microsoft or Apple Macintosh, when we think of owning a PC, but it all starts with the humble computer tower, where motherboards nurse their internal hardware to external peripherals. Manufacturers build the parts, and companies such as IBM, Acer and Dell put them together to make your ""name-brand"" PC - complete with trademark software (most likely Microsoft)."
"That’s all rather vague, so let me put it better. I’m a shy person, and I also know what anxiety feels like. I do have an anxiety disorder (generalized, if you were curious), but it has nothing to do with my shyness. My shyness is this: I don’t like meeting new people, I don’t like talking in front of groups, but I also don’t have Social Anxiety Disorder. I get nervous, but I don’t really avoid those situations, and I can overcome that nervousness. It can be unpleasant talking to new people or in front of groups, but it can also go well."

"The trek through jungles with wild animals, the torrid deserts that have to be traversed with all their dangers, eventually they get horses, gallop up mountains and down into lovely villages filled with music and song… he would have loved to stay there, but they had to carry on, through blinding snow, fighting wolves and the biting, bitter winds."
"I'd love to tell you that I graciously excused myself from our gathering and quickly walked toward the exit. I'd love to tell you that my leave from the room would have shamed any of Martha Stewart's classes on grace & poise. I'd love to tell you that I'm calm, cool, & collected in emergencies.

"Friedman wrote: Under the limited standard for SEQRA review, the court is constrained to hold that ESDC’s elaboration of its reasons for using the 10 year build-out and for not requiring an SEIS was not irrational as a matter of law. ESDC's continuing use of the 10 year build-out was supported—albeit, in this court’s opinion, only minimally—by the factors articulated by ESDC. ESDC did not, for reasons that are unexplained to this date, expressly state, in the documentation prepared in connection with its review of the 2009 plan, that the MTA agreement permitted FCRC to defer acquisition until 2030 of air rights necessary to complete construction of various buildings called for in Phase II of the Project. Contrary to petitioners’ contention, however, the documentation of ESDC’s review unquestionably demonstrates, as found above, that ESDC categorized the MTA agreement as a “major change” to the Project… and was aware of the MTA installment through 2030."

"If Tengku is to be an ordinary ‘wakil rakyat’, Tengku should please let the rulers know that Malaysia is an embarrassment because of the Constitution. As internationally and by UN considerations, even in proper application of Islam, with many of the laws and constitutional articles of Malaysia are outdated (even poorly written) and amount to a display of human rights abuse. If the citizens do not act,the citizens will continue to suffer, so when citizens act it is not out of inclination to disruptiveness but a seeking of justice."

"Look for that post coming soon."
"Yes, I know smoking was bad for me, and that I gave up before the hacking cough and health problems kicked in. I gave up before I reached 40, so I remember all the pleasure cigarettes give the young but none of the downsides, which show themselves later on in life. However, for all the wonders of the world He created, it is surely evidence of a somewhat perverse sense of humour on the part of the maker that so much in life which gives you pleasure, is either bad for you, or makes you fat. There are surely few experiences more dismal than an entirely healthy lifestyle, and that seems rather unfair."

"This novel is written in a very poetic and thoughtful way. I was drawn to the book as soon as I read the summary of the story. I have always loved historical fiction, but most of the novels I tend to read take place in England. This was a nice change, since it is set in France and actually features the famous French author, Victor Hugo! In fact, this tale is about Hugo’s wife having an affair on him—a situation which actually happened in real life."
"This is the post where I go all Loco about Valentine's Day. It's a nice holiday and all, but its not for me. It's mostly commercial, and as my dear husband has pointed out before, ""Every day is like Valentine's Day when you live with him."" That used to bug the crap out of me, but you know I totally get it. If we can't be nice and do kind things for each other 364 days out of the year, then that one day, Valentine's Day, isn't really going to make any difference even if Hallmark tells us to... I'm not completely anti, I do buy my kids a treat and a card."
"like ----. I fell off the horse and onto my butt. This stinks, this way more than stinks. I know I feel like this because I didn't work hard. I got distracted. I played around with my new phone.

Do you ever feel this way? It sucks. This is where I fail. This is where I stop. This is when I say what the hell is the point of all of this anyway?"

"So my question to you is where do you think I made the mistakes here? Where was the lesson? Well, when I was freshly going through the heartbreak, through my tears, there was a resounding I LEARNED NOTHING FROM ALL OF THIS OTHER THAN THE FACT THAT MEN, LOVE AND DATING SUCKS! If this is what it’s all about, I want no part of romantic love! I was nothing but beautiful and loving to this man, I showed my true self to him and all he did was throw it away, and left me abandoned, and I don’t even know why!!"

"It is Robert Sibley’s view that the world has become disenchanted and that the potential for religious experience has been replaced by a different kind of faith, one he calls scientism. He contends that here is a need for some kind of a sense of the divine. He’s carefully non-specific about which faith he means, but he does make reference to C.S. Lewis’s dictum that one way to acquire faith is to behave as if you have it."
"Lunch was a big salad and dinner was the veggie soup from last night plus sweet potato and carrot *fries*....I should have known I wouldn't like the baked carrots and I should have just eaten them raw.

"* Check the vintage particularly on inexpensive whites and rosés. A 2008 white may not sound that old but if it comes from Australia or Chile it's almost two years from harvest. It may even be a bit elderly for a fresh-tasting European white."
"Significant signings? Let’s start with the JUCOs. The top-rated junior-college player in the country is now a Tennessee Volunteer. Wide receiver Cordarrelle Patterson is a player of a position that is potentially an embarrassment of riches for the Vols. Patterson is one of four 4-star WRs coming in. Another is the best WR recruit out of Georgia — Jason Croom. Alton “Pig” Howard is another tasty WR signee for at least his name alone. Is Wide Receiver U back? The two other JUCOs are defensive linemen, a position that needs some experience right away. All three of the JUCOs can step in and be expected to contribute immediately."

"But it is too simplistic to claim that government support is the only reason China has had some B2B success. The strength of the country’s scientific and technical talent is growing, and local companies increasingly bring real capabilities to the table. What’s more, a number of government-supported innovation efforts have not been successful. Some notable examples include attempts to develop an indigenous 3G telecommunications protocol called TDS-CDMA and to replace the global Wi-Fi standard with a China-only Internet security protocol, WAPI."

"Two other protesters, Alexander Penley, 41, and Nicholas Thommen, 30, were slapped with several charges including assault, criminal possession of a weapon and inciting a riot."
"These things are sometimes so intensely private and personal that outside witnesses are more intruder than observer. In fact, I know some artists who proclaim they are not even curious what anyone else thinks. Their interest extends only as far as the creative vision itself. This art is not trying to engage an audience. The truth is, creative types are often simply interested in what their imagination provides or reveals, and decidedly not always in how it gets received. Sometimes our art is so internally focused that it is at most a private conversation, and an audience is only dropping eves and in butting where they are not wanted."
"Better Off Ted – After its first season I declared it the funniest new show in years, then of course ABC goes and brings Modern Family out while NBC delivers Community and makes Parks & Recreations awesome – so now Better Off Ted is just ‘one’ of the funniest new ‘shows’ in years.

"One hundred years ago, 'wireless telegraphy' was mostly used to communicate with vessels crossing the Atlantic Ocean. And these weren't signals with human voices, but rather in the dots and dashes of Morse code. Experiments with sending vocals over the airwaves were already being conducted in New York by Lee De Forest as early as 1907, but radio wouldn't seriously be considered as a means of voice transmittal for almost another decade."
"Sorvino does nothing but flirt with Nicole, presented in such detail that the film practically becomes a romantic comedy for a short period. Because that’s really what I wanted in a movie called The Stuff; a fat balding middle aged man hitting on a woman. Truly they picked the right focus for this picture. Oh and there’s a few minor parts in there about The Stuff coming to life and killing people…but that doesn’t matter too much…"

"Hope you're all having a lovely weekend, tomorrow I'm off to buy birthday presents (not for myself, sadly), and begin the hunt for a perfect pair of jeans, as I own about two pairs, neither of which fit me, however I find trousers the most tiresome things to shop for, so I'll probably just end up getting cupcakes and a Starbucks instead!"
"The honest answer is; apart from the web, we’re not entirely sure how we’re going to do this yet. This is something traditional publishers do as part of the process for each book and possibly another appealing aspect of traditional publishers. But I’ve also heard they can do very little to push a book, so it’s a tough one to call."

"Did I bring food, she asked? I always brought food."
"WWII is entering its last phase: Germany is in ruins, but does not yield. The US army lacks crucial knowledge about the German units operating on the opposite side of the Rhine, and decides to send two German prisoners to gather information. The scheme is risky: the Gestapo retains a terribly efficient network to identify and capture spies and deserters. Moreover, it is not clear that “Tiger”, who does not mind any dirty work as long as the price is right, and war-weary “Happy”, who might be easily betrayed by his feelings, are dependable agents. After Tiger and another American agent are successfully infiltrated, Happy is parachuted in Bavaria. His duty: find out the whereabouts of a powerful German armored unit moving towards the western front."

"Duncan Hines' website has pretty good instructions on how to put them together. You can find them here. The best tip, I felt, was microwaving the Oreos a few seconds to soften them so they would separate easier. When I separated them, however, I wasn't entirely successful in keeping all, or even most, of the cream on one side. I used a small off-set spatula to carefully scrape the cream off one side of the cookie and put it on the other side that had the majority of the cream filling. Then, using that spatula (having the small off-set spatula ~ you know, the kind for smoothing frosting on cakes, cupcakes ~ really made this job easy) I smoothed the cream as best as possible."
"ChristieO wants us to write a letter to ourself about the things that happen in 2012 from the point of view of it being 2013. Confused? Yeah, me too! But what a great exercise in goal setting!

Chloe has been a tad jealous of her sister Pearl who was named ""Student of the Month"" in both KG and 1st grade. She has been hoping every month since that it would be her turn. I was a little bit concerned that she might not achieve this status because she can be a bit difficult. Now, finally her dream has become a reality. Not only did Chloe earn this wonderful honor, but her best friend, who is in another class, won the very same honor. I thought it was pretty cool that two best friends both won ""Student of the Month"" for the same thing at the exact same time!"
"There are several vintage space rocket banks for sale all the time on eBay. Mostly metal, with a spring action that shoots the coin into the rocket-shaped bank. But I saw this, and once again, not exactly my usual thing, but I had to have it. Folks usually bid on the metal action banks, so this was very inexpensive. Not too ""young"" looking, is it? Well, I don't think so (I'm trying to keep the space room a bit ""older"" looking, which means passing up some cute spaceman nursery cutouts for the wall and such). 1960's - 1970's spaceman rocket coin bank."

(I would say they lack the lifetime commitment, but so do the married people, too, much of the time.) I say, why can't they have a lifetime commitment without the license while they're at it? Why can't they go by their local church, synagogue, or hippie guru and proclaim their lifetime commitment? Why in the world is it against the law for them to do this? Maybe they don't want the state to bother with them. What about that scenario is so terrible?"

"A wise (non-Muslim) friend once told me how her (wealthy and financially astute) father drew her attention to the fact that ‘the highest buildings belonged to insurance companies’, illustrating the highly profitable nature of their business. Their exaggerated profitability stems from the above mentioned odds. Interestingly, insurance companies seem to be virtually single-handedly keeping the South African Broadcasting Corporation afloat through hours-long loops of ‘infomercials’ and at least one advert during every ad break. The insurance industry is just another means through which money is sucked out of the economy in an unproductive way, making less money available for actual consumer goods.

It was actually great - although old, the equipment seemed quite well maintained, and it was excellent to see some of those old styles of activities - giant see-saws (I went on one and was quite freaked out - now that I comprehend danger to a greater extent it is far more exhilarating!) a double slide, those twirly cups you sit in, and a menagerie of bouncy animals."

Let the months pass unnoticed. Ask her to move in. Let her decorate. Get into fights about inconsequential things like how the fucking shower curtain needs to be closed so that it doesn’t fucking collect mold. Let a year pass unnoticed. Begin to notice."

Of course the first thing I did, after shakily receiving J.’s reassurances that “If anyone can do this, you can,” was hit the grocery store near my office on lunch break so I could stock up on a handful of items to make the first week easier. Almond milk – check. Gluten-free pancake mix, for emergencies – check. Organic popcorn crisps for a school snack – check. And, to be completely honest, a box of Rice Chex cereal. No, ordinarily, I don’t buy boxed cereals for the boys. And I’m not sure how proud I am of the purchase.

Cultural indicators can help you choose the best fitting business strategy or creating campaigns for certain target groups. Every culture has it’s own habits and values, for example, in the one culture individualism stands for success and in the other culture it stands for someone who is selfish. To measure some of these important cultural habits there are ‘the five cultural dimensions’: Power Distance Index, Individualism, Masculinity, Uncertainty Avoidance Index and the Long-Term Orientation. On the website www.geert-hofstede.com you can see the score of the five cultural indicators for different countries with an explanation below."

The explosives were to be shipped East, to Dulles Airport, marked as ”industrial solvent,” on the first available passenger flights, Mulcahy recalls. Once at Dulles, they were consolidated into one shipping container, along with the timers and the industrial tools and workbenches needed to set up the explosives laboratory in Libya. Then they were forwarded to Europe for transshipment by Lufthansa passenger planes to Tripoli without knowledge of the airline. All of the men involved in the meeting in Washington understood the implications of what they were doing, Mulcahy says: ”The nitro could have blown if the plane hit an air pocket.”"

Well, that's easy for me--he's not crazy, he's just a physicist. And his class ends one day when he's right in the middle of discussing EPR. So he goes home with all this at the front of his mind, keenly aware he's collapsing Wave Functions all around him. Well, as a guy, what's the one thing that is most profound to collapse by observing. That's right, his own penis. So he takes a second, whips it out, and looks at it in the mirror. Then he notices another guy watching him. And wacky hijinx ensue."

"And, the atmosphere brings me to the main point as to why we should see more international cricket at Homebush. If we want cricket to grow, it should be accessible to as many people as possible. Last night, there were kids there, probably for their first international cricket match, who would have been locked out by a SCG sellout. The extra capacity of Homebush let’s more people see the game, and it lets more kids have their first experience of the Australian cricket team – and that matters. We can either play more international games at Homebush or have families missing out on really big nights like last night because the SCG is sold out."

"Oh yeah, back to the movie, how does all this EPR rambling tie in to the movie? Well, I really wish I had seen it when Eran Kolirin was still here, because I would've loved to quiz him about it. But I can say that festival programmer Rod Armstrong introduced the movie by saying in previous Q&A's some audience members wanted to ascribe mental health issues (anything from depression to schizophrenia) to the protagonist, and Eran was adamant that he's not crazy in any way. Well, that's easy for me--he's not crazy, he's just a physicist. And his class ends one day when he's right in the middle of discussing EPR. So he goes home with all this at the front of his mind, keenly aware he's collapsing Wave Functions all around him. Well, as a guy, what's the one thing that is most profound to collapse by observing. That's right, his own penis. So he takes a second, whips it out, and looks at it in the mirror. Then he notices another guy watching him. And wacky hijinx ensue."

"This lets me have some fun 'cause all my flannels are from when I planned on cloth diapering Sunshine with some AIOs (all in ones are like washable disposable diapers with velcro tabs). We ended up using EC (Elimination Communication ) and didn't need any extra diapers so...I've a LOT of flannel. Since I'm gender neutral I picked out all the fabric I found cute. There's Bad to the Bone, Unicorns, little toadstools, Frogs, Knights with Castles, motorcycles, space, a Supergirl...just lots. I take silky ribbons that I keep every year and after 'wrapping' it like you would with paper I wrap it with the ribbon. Sometimes I'll pull it up and have this poof of fabric with a big bow. That looks nice for the solid colors. I'll take some pictures of ours to share with ya'll and hopefully you can use the idea next year. Remember...after Christmas sells!"

"The culturing of meditation into our system is normal. Some people call it the higher state of consciousness, I call it the normal state of consciousness since we are endowed with the ability to live in that state. Meditation helps in two ways-it prevents stress from getting into the system and simultaneously helps release already accumulated stress. Regular meditation also leads to happiness and fulfillment; to sensitisation of the sensory organs (thereby intensifying the experiences of seeing, tasting, feeling, etc.); and to greater intuitiveness."

"Anyhoo, long story short, lots and lots of blacks in my last neighborhood. Like, every other house. So I was jogging in one of the tonier areas of my neighborhood and there are two dogs in the front yard of this one house. They went after me like I was made out of ham. All I got was a tiny nip on the ankle. They weren’t large dogs, but they were large enough to put a scare in me. Scared, angry me stood in the middle of the street, kind of paralyzed, screaming for the home owners to get their fucking dogs. A large black man comes out of the house behind me. I snippily ask if these are his dogs. He patiently says “No.” and proceeds to clear the way for me. The dogs are intimidated by his height and decidedly not-defensive posture. They slunk away. I offered an effusive “Thank you, Sir!” and continued jogging home. I was shaken. But felt extraordinarily grateful for the nice, big, calm guy who came to my rescue. More big black guys for my neighborhood, please."

"WWII is entering its last phase: Germany is in ruins, but does not yield. The US army lacks crucial knowledge about the German units operating on the opposite side of the Rhine, and decides to send two German prisoners to gather information. The scheme is risky: the Gestapo retains a terribly efficient network to identify and capture spies and deserters. Moreover, it is not clear that “Tiger”, who does not mind any dirty work as long as the price is right, and war-weary “Happy”, who might be easily betrayed by his feelings, are dependable agents. After Tiger and another American agent are successfully infiltrated, Happy is parachuted in Bavaria. His duty: find out the whereabouts of a powerful German armored unit moving towards the western front."
"I had absolutely no shame in cheating in GTAIII. Instantly getting the fuzz off my back after going on a killing spree was such a relief. The no wanted level cheat was probably the first among GTA cheats that I memorized. And the weapons cheat. Ohhhh, the weapons cheat. Shooting people with a pistol is alright. Burning them to a crisp with the flame thrower, blowing them up with a rocket launcher? AWESOME. The rocket launcher was especially delightful to use. At times I would find some high ground and start shooting people and nuking cars. When the cops brought out a helicopter, I'd just take aim and it was down in a matter of seconds. But the granddaddy of all cheats would have to be spawning a tank. Talk about power. The tank was nigh unstoppable. Any car it touched was instantly blown up, which made me laugh like a madman every time police cars would try to stop me. The tank has never been as strong in a GTA game as it has in GTAIII, able to take a sizable amount of punishment before you can't use it anymore. As a result, it isn't as fun to use in later installments. A shame, really."

"So that’s the main thing I remember about that film. And then, of course, it was a disaster when it came out - and almost immediately it also turned into a cult film – and it still is! Frankly, I don’t quite understand why – except that there’s no movie remotely like it. I saw it again a little over 10 years ago at a film festival in Dallas. They wanted me to come down because they couldn’t get anyone else so I went. And the category it was in was called “Films We Love to Hate”. And I thought wait a minute, they didn’t tell me that! And then I was interviewed in front of an audience at a midnight showing. They were asking me about Otto Preminger. And I said he was one of the great film directors and everybody laughed out loud. Then I started to list a number of movies that are remarkable and have some range. And at every one I said, they would laugh. “Wait a minute,” I said, “This is not being fair.” “Yeah, but Skidoo - we hear it’s terrible.” And I said, “Every film director who’s made a lot of movies has made a couple that don’t work – and by the way Skidoo does have a following.” So then I settled down with them to watch the film and I was like, “Oh God, it is terrible. It’s awful.” He was trying for something original and unusual – and he was challenging himself – but he didn’t know how to do it. It just wasn’t his thing."

"I did my workout shortly after getting home. Today was Cardio Axe and Tummy Tuck. So, cardio and ab work. I've done both of these before, but not for several months. I forgot how much fun the dancing in Cardio Axe is! I just love it, and I continue to love Leandro's fun, vibrant personality. The only complaint I have with this workout is I would like it to be a little longer and/or a little more intense. It does make me sweat, but not as much as a lot of my other cardio DVDs. As for Tummy Tuck, I now remember why it's been so long since I've done this one. The routine is very good, and I'm sure it will give me nice abs, but I just don't like it very much. It involves a lot of crunches, which I'm not a big fan of (neck straining galore), and a lot of plank work. Which I actually do like, but not for about five minutes total. My shoulders are just screaming at me by the end, to the point where I can't focus on the actual ab work that's being done. I much prefer the Ab Jam routine from Turbo Jam or a couple other DVDs that I have. But it's all good. I will do that workout when I need to and completely love the rest of the program."

"These things are sometimes so intensely private and personal that outside witnesses are more intruder than observer. In fact, I know some artists who proclaim they are not even curious what anyone else thinks. Their interest extends only as far as the creative vision itself. This art is not trying to engage an audience. The truth is, creative types are often simply interested in what their imagination provides or reveals, and decidedly not always in how it gets received. Sometimes our art is so internally focused that it is at most a private conversation, and an audience is only dropping eves and in butting where they are not wanted."

"This morning, second period, with my principal in the room, I had each student and my principal write their name on a piece of paper. I turned the pieces upside down, shuffled them and then set them aside for a moment. Then, I told my students a few true stories. I told them stories of how I had come to find respect and trust in our learning space. I thanked my principal and asked her to step out. Then, slowly, with honesty and love, I drew one piece of paper at a time. Slow, as I read each name in turn, I thanked each student for the gifts they have offered me over the last 9 weeks. We cried. And we spent the rest of the day laughing, awash in tears, gratitude and reflection."

"So what is the LEED-PAC? Is it what it seems? Why have its listed proponents and financial backers ‘flocked together’? Do they have a stereotypical commonality, other than pure altruism? Could the LEED-PAC actually be a grouping of individuals who have vested financial or other interests in the outcomes of the coming elections, both in May and in November? One typecast observation is that the LEED-PAC is about maintaining a certain degree of control on economic development in LeeCounty; are they the so-called ‘establishment good ole boys’? Many of the LEED-PAC people have heavy financial interest in how development will transpire in the County. That doesn’t sound altruistic, rather it sounds eerily like keeping control on how money is made and who gets to make it. It also sound eerily like it entails how public tax dollars are spent, and who gets to benefit from that spending. Is the LEED-PAC a ‘Trayvon hoodie’ hiding something unknown, with unknown intent? Maybe it’s time to know just how innocent or sinister this group is. Perhaps someone will publish a column exposing just who these shadowy LEED-PAC people are and identify the businesses they run. Inquiring minds want to know."

"He felt that he should not perform any Vedic Rites to the Devas and the Pitrus, while under the Saapa (curse). After a fortnight of this painful existence, Gautama asked the other rshis, for a way out. At first they were silent, but on his repeated, humble, requests they asked him to do prayaschittam. Prayaschittam means a cleaning of the mind. They asked him to admit his fault and go around the earth (Prthvi) three times and come back and observe a vow (of fasting) for a month. Then go around Brahmagiri 100 and ekottara (eight?) times OR bring the Ganga and bathe in her and make one crore earthern images and worship Deva. Then bathe again in the Ganga and go round the mountain eleven times more. Then bathe the Earthern Image (Parthiva) with one hundred pots of Ganga."

"Obviously, America is not a post-racist country. The blurry line dividing the other two appellations — racism and racialism — is crossed daily in overt and subtle ways. The line’s vagueness and the sometimes inadvertent crossing of it reflect the very different American experiences of blacks and whites. The recent shooting death in Sanford,Florida, of unarmed, 17-year-old Trayvon Martin by a self-appointed neighborhood watch captain, for instance, was seen by many blacks as another instance of racial profiling. But feelings of outrage and sadness and a demand for justice crossed all racial borders."

"The attitude of the devotional organisations makes me believe that throughout Indian (and perhaps world) history the scriptures have been often mis-appropriated, misquoted and mis-interpreted by the bhakthi marga, at the cost of the gnyana marga. What gives them the right?"
"well I think I am going to go to bed and see if I can get some sleep .. my eyes are very gritty and I have a bit of double vision happening .. haha .. so I am hoping what I have written actually makes sense ... or at the very least .. legible ..."

"Released reports suggest the fire began near a temporary generator that was being used due to problems with the building's main power supply. Hey, they're monks not electricians. However, after the BBC Europe botch job we weren't entirely satisfied with the reported cause of the fire... so we conducted our own investigation. What we found was far more sinister than a Honda generator."
"But at least I can experience it."
"And that was another thing; their new allies had been fairly accepting of the existence of the Naaru. Some paid them no mind, but many thought their existence sparked curiosity as to their existence and provided even more questions to ask about their faith in the Light. A new era had begun for them, prompting pamphlets, booklets, and novels on the subject. Experts on the Light made copies for all the major churches and sanctuaries of the Light, included their ship turned city, Exodar."

"If Tengku is to be an ordinary ‘wakil rakyat’, Tengku should please let the rulers know that Malaysia is an embarrassment because of the Constitution. As internationally and by UN considerations, even in proper application of Islam, with many of the laws and constitutional articles of Malaysia are outdated (even poorly written) and amount to a display of human rights abuse. If the citizens do not act,the citizens will continue to suffer, so when citizens act it is not out of inclination to disruptiveness but a seeking of justice."

"I did my workout shortly after getting home. Today was Cardio Axe and Tummy Tuck. So, cardio and ab work. I've done both of these before, but not for several months. I forgot how much fun the dancing in Cardio Axe is! I just love it, and I continue to love Leandro's fun, vibrant personality. The only complaint I have with this workout is I would like it to be a little longer and/or a little more intense. It does make me sweat, but not as much as a lot of my other cardio DVDs. As for Tummy Tuck, I now remember why it's been so long since I've done this one. The routine is very good, and I'm sure it will give me nice abs, but I just don't like it very much. It involves a lot of crunches, which I'm not a big fan of (neck straining galore), and a lot of plank work. Which I actually do like, but not for about five minutes total. My shoulders are just screaming at me by the end, to the point where I can't focus on the actual ab work that's being done. I much prefer the Ab Jam routine from Turbo Jam or a couple other DVDs that I have. But it's all good. I will do that workout when I need to and completely love the rest of the program."
"Perhaps the comparison to Tie Me Up! Tie Me Down! is more apt than I’d first thought. Both films concern men who invent peculiar ideals for their lovers, and convince themselves that these women share their feelings. Talk to Her may be a somewhat more sober, mature exploration of this particular kind of obsessive love, but I think I prefer Tie Me Up! In the end, its lightness (along with the power of the female lead) renders the subject matter somewhat less disturbing."
"** Update:"
"I was expecting to be sleeping off a big ol' hangover today in the confines of my house, enjoying the last few days of my winter break and the dulcet tones of my darling daughters as they bean each other with Wii remotes. However, sadly, I find myself BACK in Kansas City - wherein I just left not five days ago - as my mother has become seriously ill. Thus, I flew back today, and here I am, in the land of single-degree temperatures (9, at present,) watching my mom sleep in her hospital bed."

He is an adorable, funny, smart, witty, silly, and happy little boy (I can't say baby anymore:( On Thursday (2/23/12) he got ear tubes put in his ears because of chronic ear infections and fluid stuck in his ears which meant his ear drums weren't working correctly.

"They are both very different short story collections. Possibly couldn't be any different. Blue Has No South is a collection of 115 short fictions, that I would variously describe as fables, puzzles, poems, true stories, warnings, dreams, histories, myths, found stories. They are brief, intense, distilled, and this is probably a book I will dip into many times again. Hot Kitchen Snow is more traditional, in the sense that it contains the kind of short stories we might expect when we say short stories. It was a bit of a slow burner for me, but left me thinking wow..."

That was quite a day.)"
"I had heard that Beads of Courage had found a supplier for their butterfly beads, which is true. However, I have found, through dialogues on Lampwork Etc., that when artisan butterfly beads are available, Beads of Courage does want to use and will use the artusan made beads, too.

"Remembering that we just got out of the most civil-war-filled century in Roman history (the 200′s, early 300′s), it’s logical that Constantine (who CERTAINLY knew himself how to civil-war it to the top) would solidify governmental changes to make sure that it was very difficult for generals/sons of emperors to make war against HIM.

Burek posted a really sweet video guide to using Force Push yesterday. So that was fresh on my mind. Now, I have a pretty regular rotation that I use. Force Push is in it, but it’s buried pretty deep and typically only gets used on elites because everything else dies before I get to it, except for random occasions when I use it as an interrupt.

"Something stirred within him. Shouts and chatter rang in his ears, palms sweating and fingers twitching in nervousness. The white walls surrounding him didn’t do much for his paranoia either. Gislenus couldn’t stand it, but he had to. Somewhere, the clock ticked out a monotone song. He didn’t bother looking at the time, by the way the professor looked around, he knew the bell was going to ring in any minute. Then, he’d be able to go and fix any problem his family had that day. Sure, they’d yell and scream at him, but he’d get the job done one way or another."

Though not without their perils, they assume deeper meaning in the universe and attempt to process the challenges of living through that understanding. This lends itself to hope, and perseverance.

Go out, meet your neighbors, invest at a local club, try a church or synagogue or mosque. Find fellowship with those around you."

It was actually great - although old, the equipment seemed quite well maintained, and it was excellent to see some of those old styles of activities - giant see-saws (I went on one and was quite freaked out - now that I comprehend danger to a greater extent it is far more exhilarating!) a double slide, those twirly cups you sit in, and a menagerie of bouncy animals."

"The first and most significant for traditional Christians who are sacramentally oriented, will be the Eucharist. In the Eucharist, Christ is supposed to transport the communicant to the event of calvary, along with the resurrection, and more broadly the creation of the world along with the eschaton. In the Eucharist, the communicant is re-presented with Christ himself, making both past events and future events really present realities. This poses a problem, however, if events in the future are in no sense real, which is what the A theorist is committed to. Although perhaps God could somehow re-present what was in the past as present, he could not present us with what is in the future, and is in no sense real. Imagine how the Eucharist at the Last supper looks if we admit that Christ had in no sense yet died for his Church."

"Medium Fish are the standard, so I’m going to start here. Basically, if the PCs are meant to be ‘medium’, it means that, while they are generally quite capable, there are a lot of big baddies in the world they can’t handle. Your average thugs and minions aren’t much of a problem, the elite guards of the enemy should pose a significant health threat, and the big, big baddies should be beyond their capabilities until they either find a clever way to defeat them or grow in power somehow."
"In this respect, sinister role of Indian RAW could also be judged from some other events of sectarian violence. In 2008, in Khyber Agency, intermittent fighting between Lashkar-e-Islam and Ansar-ul-Islam had claimed as many as 1500 lives. Lashkar Islami is led by fanatic cleric Mangal Bagh who follows the puritanical Deobandi form of Sunni Islam and has close connections with the extremist Taliban of Afghanistan. Besides other areas of Pakistan, more than 2000 people died in sectarian riots in Kurram Agency, bordering Afghanistan. Its areas have been hit by fierce clashes, pitching Sunni Muslims against the minority Shias. A number of ceasefires was concluded between the warring sects with the help of government officials and the tribal Maliks, but the same proved fruitless owing to the support from Afghanistan where more than hundred training centers covertly established by RAW are supervising anti-Pakistan activities with the tactical help CIA and Mossad."

The good-byes at the hospital were heartbreaking, death is always so hard for those of us who are left behind but there was peace, she was reuniting with her Love and returning home."
"And then came our favorite comment: ""Wow, I thought you were a lot older."" We must have looked surprised, because the commenter added: ""You know, I thought you were a bunch of older nuns from Bulgaria singing and here you are, so young..."" We told him to quit while he was ahead."
"Normally it isn’t that weird to see Jews and Druzes in a positive relation, but this case differs, since the Druze youths are from Majdal Shams, which is situated in the Golan, next to the Syrian border, and many of the Druzes there holds great sympathy for Syria, at least among the older generation. I have talked with some younger Druzes from the Golan, who told me that their generation felt more connected to Israel, though the older generation wanted to return to Syria. That was some years ago though and I don’t know how it is today, though I don’t think it has changed that much."

There are two towers directly across the road from the Pragya Kendra in Tigara panchayat and a third is being erected in the vicinity.

"2) The More-Than-Obvious Scorsese Connection - It is certainly no secret that Martin Scorsese is one of the biggest influences on PTA's career, but it is more evident in Boogie Nights than anywhere else in the auteur's oeuvre, and the most obvious Scorsese-influenced connection is to the master's 1990 modern day masterpiece Goodfellas. From the rags to riches and back to rags story arc of Goodfellas' Henry Hill and Boogie Nights' Dirk Diggler to the ever-roaming, ever-moving camera of both films, the long, always-sharp-eyed tracking shots, Anderson shows his prowess as a filmmaker while also honoring his stylistic mentor with a hot-blooded homage. To watch as Wahlberg's wouldbe porn icon weaves his way through clubs and pool parties and recording studios is like watching Ray Liotta leading a wide-eyed, bewildered Lorraine Bracco through the back passages of the Copacabana in Goodfellas. Great stuff indeed."

"Oh yeah, back to the movie, how does all this EPR rambling tie in to the movie? Well, I really wish I had seen it when Eran Kolirin was still here, because I would've loved to quiz him about it. But I can say that festival programmer Rod Armstrong introduced the movie by saying in previous Q&A's some audience members wanted to ascribe mental health issues (anything from depression to schizophrenia) to the protagonist, and Eran was adamant that he's not crazy in any way. Well, that's easy for me--he's not crazy, he's just a physicist. And his class ends one day when he's right in the middle of discussing EPR. So he goes home with all this at the front of his mind, keenly aware he's collapsing Wave Functions all around him. Well, as a guy, what's the one thing that is most profound to collapse by observing. That's right, his own penis. So he takes a second, whips it out, and looks at it in the mirror. Then he notices another guy watching him. And wacky hijinx ensue."

"In this system, it's acceptable to let a 70 year old, die while giving care to a 25 year old, because their life is worth more to the collective - excuse me - worth more to society. To paraphrase their quote, ""it's not discrimination to deny care to the 70 year old and give it to the 25 year old. Everyone who is now 70 was once 25 and the majority of those who are 25 now will be 70 some day"". In other words, ""we can screw you now because we didn't screw you earlier; and if we're not screwing you now, wait until you're 70 and then you'll really be screwed."" The implications are obvious: if a twenty-something needs a liver or kidney transplant and a suitable donor person below 10 or over 50 (judging by Emanuel's chart) is available, these ethics standards say go ahead and kill the kid or kill the grandma and get the working ""unit"" back to work so ""it"" can make money and pay taxes to the mighty Fed.gov hydra."

"In South Africa, today, being white means to cross the T's and dot the I's of political correctness, to silently assume the role of the historically guilty and to never question or criticize the new establishment's intentions. Ranging from board meetings to retail store queues, you have to pretend that you subscribe to the new 'moral' order. The notion is that whites have never suffered and that they cannot be victims. Instead, whites are commonly portrayed as the authors of suffering and hardship. This politically correct dogma has turned into an unprecedented form of Orwellian Thought Policing, not even experienced under apartheid."
"We're still listening."
"I’ve written extensively about ways to restrain the economic power of the wealthy, which largely point to making our tax system more progressive and harder to evade, eliminating corporate welfare, and regulating financial capital to the point where it’s “safe, stable, and boring.” One rare area where there is widespread popular support for progressive causes is tax fairness – witness the popularity of the “Buffett Rule” in the U.S, the unpopularity of Chancellor Osborne’s decision to lower the top income bracket in the U.K, and Hollande of the French Socialists staking his platform on a top tax rate of 75% on the wealthiest."

Some paid them no mind, but many thought their existence sparked curiosity as to their existence and provided even more questions to ask about their faith in the Light. A new era had begun for them, prompting pamphlets, booklets, and novels on the subject. Experts on the Light made copies for all the major churches and sanctuaries of the Light, included their ship turned city, Exodar."

"Over the past 40 years, median house prices have doubled relative to household incomes in the Golden State. Why? In 1998, Dartmouth economist William Fischel found that California's housing had been nearly as affordable as the rest of the nation until the more restrictive regulations, such as development moratoria, urban growth boundaries, and overly expensive impact fees came into effect starting in the 1970s. Other economic studies, such as by Stephen Malpezzi at the University of Wisconsin, also have documented the strong relationship between more intense land-use regulations and exorbitant house prices."

"Of course, most practising vampires drain the life from an unblood once in a while, but most make sure they have a careful balance between kills and the safer consumption of vampire blood. After all, in terms of quality the taste of vampire blood is generally more satisfying, more complex and bolder in its flavour than that of a normal, unconverted human being. And the most delicious blood of all, the Pinot Rouge every blood lover knows is the best on offer, is the blood taken from someone’s veins the moment after conversion."

I blog because I want to have a journal my kids can look back on when they get older, or God forbid something happen to me I want something for my family to look back on and see where some of my thoughts were. Because, of that I don't blog to much about particular personal issues, and I don't ""air my laundry"" on here.

The mysterious hijacker takes him to a secret military base where Maki is quarantined in a huge concrete reinforced bunker. His demands to know why are met with stoic silence. Finally, once Maki is securely locked into the bunker’s basement under guard and unable to escape, he is told the answer."

Another is the best WR recruit out of Georgia — Jason Croom. Alton “Pig” Howard is another tasty WR signee for at least his name alone. Is Wide Receiver U back?

"RDX, the most lethal and unstable material, was to be placed inside 55-gallon drums in webbing and the drums then were to be filled with a gel substance. The explosives were to be shipped East, to Dulles Airport, marked as ”industrial solvent,” on the first available passenger flights, Mulcahy recalls. Once at Dulles, they were consolidated into one shipping container, along with the timers and the industrial tools and workbenches needed to set up the explosives laboratory in Libya. Then they were forwarded to Europe for transshipment by Lufthansa passenger planes to Tripoli without knowledge of the airline. All of the men involved in the meeting in Washington understood the implications of what they were doing, Mulcahy says: ”The nitro could have blown if the plane hit an air pocket.”"

The Fellow will travel to villages with BBNA staff to meet with clients and provide estate planning services. The Fellow will be supervised by Center personnel and will have on-site contact with an Alaska Legal Services attorney. This is a unique opportunity for a recent law school graduate to gain hands-on legal experience in a unique location! BBNA members have special estate planning needs, and the Fellow will undergo training on those special needs, as well as estate planning for native Alaskans.

And I return to it again and again, for inspiration, for comfort, for new ways to look at this crazy thing that we all do called writing. The title of the book explains how to tackle the seemingly impossible task of writing a book.

He told her little brother to ""just take it bird by bird."" Read it. Today!"

"These things are sometimes so intensely private and personal that outside witnesses are more intruder than observer. In fact, I know some artists who proclaim they are not even curious what anyone else thinks. Their interest extends only as far as the creative vision itself.

Sometimes our art is so internally focused that it is at most a private conversation, and an audience is only dropping eves and in butting where they are not wanted."

"""The object of this Essay is to assert one very simple principle, as entitled to govern absolutely the dealings of society with the individual in the way of compulsion and control, whether the means used be physical force in the form of legal penalties, or the moral coercion of public opinion. That principle is, that the sole end for which mankind are warranted, individually or collectively, in interfering with the liberty of action of any of their number, is self-protection. That the only purpose for which power can be rightfully exercised over any member of a civilised community, against his will, is to prevent harm to others. His own good, either physical or moral, is not a sufficient warrant. He cannot rightfully be compelled to do or forbear because it will be better for him to do so, because it will make him happier, because, in the opinions of others, to do so would be wise, or even right. These are good reasons for remonstrating with him, or reasoning with him, or persuading him, or entreating him, but not for compelling him, or visiting him with any evil in case he do otherwise. To justify that, the conduct from which it is desired to deter him must be calculated to produce evil to some one else. The only part of the conduct of any one, for which he is amenable to society, is that which concerns others. In the part which merely concerns himself, his independence is, of right, absolute. Over himself, over his own body and mind, the individual is sovereign."""

"Up next was Emma Wild from CBI on the business perspective on IP. She stated that the UK IP regime is respected around the world, and reminded us that many UK industries rely on patents, copyright, and trade marks to protect their designs and creativity. She considered that the Government needs to be a champion for IP and IP rich industries, and advocated collaboration with industry to protect business models which rely on IP. In particular, she spoke against expansion of copyright exceptions that would undermine these business models."

"Therefore, we must ask ourselves when we see miracles and signs: How do we know if a sign is from God? We know by the same yardstick of God’s teaching and by the example of Jesus’ own works. We know that God doesn’t deal in parlor tricks and when he moves there is no doubt. We know that Jesus performed miracles humbly, even going as far as to perform miracles away from crowds and to urge secrecy (Mark 7). God is not a showman, he is interested in restoring lives. Even pharaoh’s magicians could whip up some plagues, and even a motivational speaker can make people fall down. Just because it’s a spirit doesn’t mean it’s the spirit, and just because people hoot and holler doesn’t mean its any more spiritual than a rock concert. Just because somebody is charismatic it doesn’t follow that they are spirit filled. Just because someone is pious it doesn’t follow that they are closer to God’s character. Listen closely, people can be radical and be wrong."

"A wise (non-Muslim) friend once told me how her (wealthy and financially astute) father drew her attention to the fact that ‘the highest buildings belonged to insurance companies’, illustrating the highly profitable nature of their business. Their exaggerated profitability stems from the above mentioned odds. Interestingly, insurance companies seem to be virtually single-handedly keeping the South African Broadcasting Corporation afloat through hours-long loops of ‘infomercials’ and at least one advert during every ad break. The insurance industry is just another means through which money is sucked out of the economy in an unproductive way, making less money available for actual consumer goods.

"What unfortunately follows is – with the software application acting as a security blanket of project management commitment – true PM techniques and principles are often never learned (nor the application, mind you). Firms utilize the “accidental project management” approach, throw a few activities into an .mpp file, and focus much of their effort on the maximizing the practice of “project management by powerpoint” As a consultant, the most important thing to remember is this – Project Management is in the eye of the beholder (no matter what PMI or PRINCE2 or any other BOK may say.) If your client manages projects through Ouija boards and crayons, then so do you. We must learn to adapt and apply what we’ve learned as project managers to each client and each situation. As PM’s, we should never force feed. We must suggest, nurture, cajole – introduce slowly the project management concepts we know and love – and are enablers of success!. After all, they hired us to be project managers, right?"

Every culture has it’s own habits and values, for example, in the one culture individualism stands for success and in the other culture it stands for someone who is selfish. To measure some of these important cultural habits there are ‘the five cultural dimensions’: Power Distance Index, Individualism, Masculinity, Uncertainty Avoidance Index and the Long-Term Orientation. On the website www.geert-hofstede.com you can see the score of the five cultural indicators for different countries with an explanation below."
"Before His denial, Peter had asserted that even if all others denied Christ, he would not. So Jesus begins by asking that question — “do you love Me more than these?” A humbled Peter drops the comparison and simply asserts, “Yes, Lord, you know that I love you.” So Jesus presses further, “Do you love Me?” That is, “Do you? Do you really love in the way that you say you do?” And Peter asserts that he not only loves Jesus, but that Jesus knows that he does. One final time Jesus asks, “Do you love Me?” The force of this seems to be, “Peter, as you reflect on your inward desires and passions, do you really love Me?” Peter was grieved over this third question, perhaps because it reminded him of his denials and perhaps because it had to be asked three times, but he responds, “Lord, you know all things. You know that I love you.” In this final affirmation he is just as emphatic as he was in his final denial in which he invoked the curses of God (Mt. 26:74). Yes, he loves Christ."

We are living in troubled times and as much as I hate to admit this, I believe that we as the Church have invited this upon ourselves by placing evil or ungodly men in positions of governmental power and influence who have used their positions of influence to enact laws that now threaten families and especially the safety of our own children. Without getting political, let me say that your voice matters and the fact that we have not supported Born Again governmental leaders or demanded that the ungodly follow Biblical principles in leading our nation has brought us to the kind of problems echoed in this troubling report. Check it out."
"Processed foods like deli meats contain a lot of sodium, which can interrupt sleep by raising your blood pressure and dehydrating you, Cornell’s Maas says. Caffeine, meanwhile, stays in your system for up to 12 hours, so the effects of a p.m. latte could linger till midnight. Try skipping the joe tomorrow: Not having caffeine for a single day can improve sleep quality that night, a study in the Journal of Clinical Nursing found."

"Significant signings? Let’s start with the JUCOs. The top-rated junior-college player in the country is now a Tennessee Volunteer.

Another is the best WR recruit out of Georgia — Jason Croom. Alton “Pig” Howard is another tasty WR signee for at least his name alone. Is Wide Receiver U back? The two other JUCOs are defensive linemen, a position that needs some experience right away. All three of the JUCOs can step in and be expected to contribute immediately."

"Denied! Most men in Virginia City wore something Dickens would have worn. Mr. Stetson didn't sell his first hat until 1865, a few years after my books are set. Mark Twain, (my vocabulary source for 1862), describes himself as arriving in Virginia City with a slouch hat, a soft felt hat usually of brown or black. That's the type of hat my character is wearing on the front cover of my book. So in my books my male characters wear plug hats, stovepipe hats or slouch hats. And my women are almost universally in bonnets. The dude on the black and white carte de visite up above is Tom Peasley, a famous Virginia City Sheriff from 1866."

"Alfred did not neglect in conveying to me the difficult times in his life. He had spoken about discrimination against the Irish, anti-intellectualism in America, and the McCarthy era. He had simply adored Robert ‘Cal’ Lowell and in one somber moment Alfred described to me in harrowing detail a night that Cal showed up at Athens Street in full manic rage. Lowell was dear to Alfred. He admitted that in those days little was known of mental illness, although Lowell would later improve with lithium. A professor I had at USC who had had Lowell for a graduate seminar saved the paper that Lowell commented on. Alfred went dark describing that long-ago night when Lowell had appeared at his house in a maniac rage. The account was both harrowing as it was sobering. I’ve read Lowell biographies but what Alfred described to me has not been written about. It has since made me admire Lowell’s ability to write at all. With that said, I will not detail it nor will I describe Alfred’s pain and horror at the meeting between Robert Frost and Ezra Pound at a time when Pound was being evaluated for legal action for his war-time radio broadcasts. This was before St. Elizabeth’s Hospital. Try as I might to be objective, I cannot read Frost’s poetry."
"I’ve written extensively about ways to restrain the economic power of the wealthy, which largely point to making our tax system more progressive and harder to evade, eliminating corporate welfare, and regulating financial capital to the point where it’s “safe, stable, and boring.” One rare area where there is widespread popular support for progressive causes is tax fairness – witness the popularity of the “Buffett Rule” in the U.S, the unpopularity of Chancellor Osborne’s decision to lower the top income bracket in the U.K, and Hollande of the French Socialists staking his platform on a top tax rate of 75% on the wealthiest."

"Yes, I know smoking was bad for me, and that I gave up before the hacking cough and health problems kicked in. I gave up before I reached 40, so I remember all the pleasure cigarettes give the young but none of the downsides, which show themselves later on in life. However, for all the wonders of the world He created, it is surely evidence of a somewhat perverse sense of humour on the part of the maker that so much in life which gives you pleasure, is either bad for you, or makes you fat. There are surely few experiences more dismal than an entirely healthy lifestyle, and that seems rather unfair."
"I’ve only ever written novels, though I wouldn’t mind a tilt at TV one day. They are very different media which is why you need to change things, substantially sometimes, when you transfer stories between them. Novels work on the imagination and, if they succeed, take the reader directly into the story. TV is a passive medium in which the screen is the boss and says ‘Watch now’ until it’s done. And you have actors in TV – wonderful actors in the case of The Killing, which means they can get away with unresolved narrative issues which would never be allowed in a book. TV has a visceral immediacy and the ability to mix the visual, the auditory and the dramatic in a way that can root you to the spot. Books are more subtle it seems to me, and ultimately more memorable. My take on The Killing departs from the TV version in some very significant ways, especially at the end. But it’s been interesting that some devoted Killing followers haven’t spotted that. It’s because TV is very much of the moment, I suspect. You’re a spectator, not a participant as you are in a good book. That said I’d still like to write TV before long – it’s such an adventurous and ambitious medium in the right hands."
"Reminds me of one of the quotes from Steve Job's 2005 commencement address at Stanford, excerpts of which are being aired everywhere right now:"
"In South Africa, today, being white means to cross the T's and dot the I's of political correctness, to silently assume the role of the historically guilty and to never question or criticize the new establishment's intentions. Ranging from board meetings to retail store queues, you have to pretend that you subscribe to the new 'moral' order. The notion is that whites have never suffered and that they cannot be victims. Instead, whites are commonly portrayed as the authors of suffering and hardship. This politically correct dogma has turned into an unprecedented form of Orwellian Thought Policing, not even experienced under apartheid."

"Duncan Hines' website has pretty good instructions on how to put them together. You can find them here. The best tip, I felt, was microwaving the Oreos a few seconds to soften them so they would separate easier. When I separated them, however, I wasn't entirely successful in keeping all, or even most, of the cream on one side. I used a small off-set spatula to carefully scrape the cream off one side of the cookie and put it on the other side that had the majority of the cream filling. Then, using that spatula (having the small off-set spatula ~ you know, the kind for smoothing frosting on cakes, cupcakes ~ really made this job easy) I smoothed the cream as best as possible."

They often say that no matter the experience, most important are the people you meet and the friends you make along the way... Well, i was truly blessed to have met Line during my 2nd year at University and for the next 4 years, we were almost inseparable. She quickly became one of my dearest friends, my 'Partner in Crime' as we liked to call each other back then. Nowadays, we don't get to see each other or talk that often, but she will always hold a very special place in my heart and will always be at the top of the list, where best friends are concerned!"

From the busy Red Sea port of Aqaba through the historical Wadi Rum desert of Lawrence of Arabia fame, to the pink carved sandstone of Petra, the small country is capitalizing on its beauty, history, and geography. Its economy benefits from the trucks and the tour buses - an alliance that serves this petroleum absent country well and tourists most."
"I lived in the 2nd Arrondissement by the Place des Victoire for five years, and every day I stepped outside my door, I felt like I was in a fairy tale. I live in the 20th Arrondissement now, and I've grown to love and appreciate its greenness, its young creator energy, the wonderful food that surrounds me, and being in a real neighborhood. But I have to say that the center of Paris is my spiritual home. Probably the 2nd (or 1st) Arrondissement would still be my favorite spot. Beauty, history, convenience. Ah..."
"Rejection – of course! I have an enormous box of rejection letters – and they are just the ones I didn't tear up or burn.

So I should be thick-skinned by now..."
"I saw people get out wheelchairs in 1970 in just a few weeks after starting L-DOPA (which had just been released in the USA) for their Parkinson’s disease. Could anything remotely similar happen in Alzheimer’s disease? I think it’s possible if the problems with thinking and forming new memories are due to the senile cluttering up the brain (a very big if). First, more than just a little bit of neuroanatomic and neurophysiologic background."

"So that’s the main thing I remember about that film. And then, of course, it was a disaster when it came out - and almost immediately it also turned into a cult film – and it still is! Frankly, I don’t quite understand why – except that there’s no movie remotely like it. I saw it again a little over 10 years ago at a film festival in Dallas. They wanted me to come down because they couldn’t get anyone else so I went. And the category it was in was called “Films We Love to Hate”. And I thought wait a minute, they didn’t tell me that! And then I was interviewed in front of an audience at a midnight showing. They were asking me about Otto Preminger. And I said he was one of the great film directors and everybody laughed out loud. Then I started to list a number of movies that are remarkable and have some range. And at every one I said, they would laugh. “Wait a minute,” I said, “This is not being fair.” “Yeah, but Skidoo - we hear it’s terrible.” And I said, “Every film director who’s made a lot of movies has made a couple that don’t work – and by the way Skidoo does have a following.” So then I settled down with them to watch the film and I was like, “Oh God, it is terrible. It’s awful.” He was trying for something original and unusual – and he was challenging himself – but he didn’t know how to do it. It just wasn’t his thing."
"So, we get past the jokes and we do small talk for a few minutes. The dude then admits that he was a good krumper and can show me the moves, right on the train. I get way too excited over this, because I love love love hip hop dance and admire any of those bitches who do it and do it well. He’s a recreational krumper. Then instead of krumping, he continues chatting. So I say,”Uh, are you gonna get your krump on or what?”"

Rest assured the grog will not just sit in my fridge and be necked whilst I lounge on the couch farting and watching documentaries on channel four about fat kids, and laughing my head off when they run. Of course I’ll have to check the grog for quality control purposes, but the Belgians will be welcome to come and pick up their grog any time they like."

"Significant signings? Let’s start with the JUCOs. The top-rated junior-college player in the country is now a Tennessee Volunteer. Wide receiver Cordarrelle Patterson is a player of a position that is potentially an embarrassment of riches for the Vols. Patterson is one of four 4-star WRs coming in. Another is the best WR recruit out of Georgia — Jason Croom. Alton “Pig” Howard is another tasty WR signee for at least his name alone. Is Wide Receiver U back? The two other JUCOs are defensive linemen, a position that needs some experience right away. All three of the JUCOs can step in and be expected to contribute immediately."
"This was a surmountable operational difficulty presented by the linguistic differences between people who were visually indistinguishable. But when we consider the nature of our Muslim Troubles, we see immediately that operating undercover in this fashion is not going to be possible to any significant extent. Nearly all of the Muslims in the UK are something other than white, and nearly everyone in the British army is white. This means that putting together a Det-style army unit to go and prowl around in Muslim areas will be impossible, as there will be no significant pool of suitable people in the army to recruit from for the purpose. It will surely not be beyond the ken of Muslims to see that mysterious white converts to Islam who start coming into their areas may not be exactly what they seem. This is what we will call the mutual impermeability problem, a problem which will bedevil the efforts of all parties to the conflict one way or another. It will be one of the biggest and most significant differences between the Troubles and our forthcoming Muslim Troubles."
"Some girls start in life with the idea that to snub the opposite sex is the surest way of bringing it to their feet. All such imaginings are vain! A man may be amused by the coquettish impertinences of a girl, he may even be attracted by it to a certain extent, but in the end he feels repulsion, and unless it be the exception that proves the rule, hastens away presently to lay his name and fortune at the disposal of some more modest girl."

Governments are waking up to the evil of Marmite, but I don't think it's a war that can ever be one. If only there was a way of recognising Marmite lovers, then it might be easier. You know, we could get them to wear special badges, or round them up and get them to live in certain areas so we could keep an eye on them and make sure they don't spread their vile Marmite love. Surely we have a duty to protect our children from Marmite?"

"What unfortunately follows is – with the software application acting as a security blanket of project management commitment – true PM techniques and principles are often never learned (nor the application, mind you). Firms utilize the “accidental project management” approach, throw a few activities into an .mpp file, and focus much of their effort on the maximizing the practice of “project management by powerpoint” As a consultant, the most important thing to remember is this – Project Management is in the eye of the beholder (no matter what PMI or PRINCE2 or any other BOK may say.) If your client manages projects through Ouija boards and crayons, then so do you. We must learn to adapt and apply what we’ve learned as project managers to each client and each situation. As PM’s, we should never force feed. We must suggest, nurture, cajole – introduce slowly the project management concepts we know and love – and are enablers of success!. After all, they hired us to be project managers, right?"

"Besides the health, financial, and environmental reasons, there is of course the ethical reason. Is it correct that 70 Billion animals are raised each year only to become food for humans? The vast majority of these animals live lives of such unimaginable squalor and suffering as to dull the senses. There seems to be a widespread idea that animals, for some reason, don’t feel pain or suffering like humans, or that they only exist to feed humans. These are such juvenile ideas that they would almost be laughable if they weren’t so repugnant. Notwithstanding the active abuse dished out to untold numbers of animals and the horrible conditions that they inhabit during their short, sad lives, the worst part of this issue is the fact that most humans feel that there is nothing wrong in our very mentally which justifies the slavery and subservience of all other animals to our appetites and whims, and that humans are naturally superior and ordained to dominate and rule the earth because we are the most intelligent species. This is an example of an intelligence I want no part of. We are animals too, and this slavery and abuse is unacceptable and should not be tolerated or even allowed."

"Before His denial, Peter had asserted that even if all others denied Christ, he would not. So Jesus begins by asking that question — “do you love Me more than these?” A humbled Peter drops the comparison and simply asserts, “Yes, Lord, you know that I love you.” So Jesus presses further, “Do you love Me?” That is, “Do you? Do you really love in the way that you say you do?” And Peter asserts that he not only loves Jesus, but that Jesus knows that he does. One final time Jesus asks, “Do you love Me?” The force of this seems to be, “Peter, as you reflect on your inward desires and passions, do you really love Me?” Peter was grieved over this third question, perhaps because it reminded him of his denials and perhaps because it had to be asked three times, but he responds, “Lord, you know all things. You know that I love you.” In this final affirmation he is just as emphatic as he was in his final denial in which he invoked the curses of God (Mt. 26:74). Yes, he loves Christ."

M. Premachandra, Ossie Abeygunasekara MPand Gamini Wijesekara MP.[168][169]"

Making a difference by helping students not just to dream, but to DO. I have some big shoes to fill."

"ONCE UPON A TIME, a little boy with a big sword went into battle against Mister Rogers. Or maybe, if the truth be told, Mister Rogers went into battle against a little boy with a big sword, for Mister Rogers didn’t like the big sword. It was one of those swords that really isn’t a sword at all; it was a big plastic contraption with lights and sound effects, and it was the kind of sword used in defense of the universe by the heroes of the television shows that the little boy liked to watch. The little boy with the big sword did not watch Mister Rogers. In fact, the little boy with the big sword didn’t know who Mister Rogers was, and so when Mister Rogers knelt down in front of him, the little boy with the big sword looked past him and through him, and when Mister Rogers said, “Oh, my; that’s a big sword you have,” the boy didn’t answer, and finally his mother got embarrassed and said, “Oh, honey, c’mon, that’s Mister Rogers,” and felt his head for fever. Of course, she knew who Mister Rogers was, because she had grown up with him, and she knew that he was good for her son, and so now, with her little boy zombie-eyed under his blond bangs, she apologized, saying to Mister Rogers that she knew he was in a rush and that she knew he was here in Penn Station taping his program and that her son usually wasn’t like this, he was probably just tired …. Except that Mister Rogers wasn’t going anywhere. Yes, sure, he was taping, and right there, in Penn Station in New York City, were throngs of other children wiggling in wait for him, but right now his patient gray eyes were fixed on the little boy with the big sword, and so he stayed there, on one knee, until the little boy’s eyes finally focused on Mister Rogers, and he said, “It’s not a sword; it’s a death ray.” A death ray! Oh, honey, Mommy knew you could do it …. And so now, encouraged, Mommy said, “Do you want to give Mister Rogers a hug, honey?” But the boy was shaking his head no, and Mister Rogers was sneaking his face past the big sword and the armor of the little boy’s eyes and whispering something in his ear–something that, while not changing his mind about the hug, made the little boy look at Mister Rogers in a new way, with the eyes of a child at last, and nod his head yes."

To live and work for what looked like at least ten years. Never before in my life had I had a prayer answered. Whats more, I don’t think I wound up in Hawai’i just because its GREEN, I think it was because of Aloha, and how I needed that to help heal my soul too. I know there is two parts to every equation and that I must learn what Hawai’i needs from me as well, and I am learning, but for me Aloha is an answer to a much deeper and more profoundly impactful question, “how do we heal the sickness that is ravaging our world?” The same sickness of people using each other that I escaped from in Vegas and is spreading across the world, I honestly believe the answer is Aloha. I already love this place, and I wound up here for a reason, I’m not an invader, but want to help defend it, and spread its medicine."

"So what is the LEED-PAC? Is it what it seems? Why have its listed proponents and financial backers ‘flocked together’? Do they have a stereotypical commonality, other than pure altruism? Could the LEED-PAC actually be a grouping of individuals who have vested financial or other interests in the outcomes of the coming elections, both in May and in November? One typecast observation is that the LEED-PAC is about maintaining a certain degree of control on economic development in LeeCounty; are they the so-called ‘establishment good ole boys’? Many of the LEED-PAC people have heavy financial interest in how development will transpire in the County. That doesn’t sound altruistic, rather it sounds eerily like keeping control on how money is made and who gets to make it. It also sound eerily like it entails how public tax dollars are spent, and who gets to benefit from that spending. Is the LEED-PAC a ‘Trayvon hoodie’ hiding something unknown, with unknown intent? Maybe it’s time to know just how innocent or sinister this group is. Perhaps someone will publish a column exposing just who these shadowy LEED-PAC people are and identify the businesses they run. Inquiring minds want to know."

"So, first up, these three books came from The Works on Tuesday. ""But Ellie, didst thou not already pillage Ye Olde Works of Yonder Town last week?"" I hear you cry. Well, yes, but this was a different store with different stock, and I was hurting after my first physiotherapy appointment. I also came home with a bundle of super-nostalgic sweets from the old-fashioned sweet emporium, so you can see what kind of mood I was in. Anyway, Arlene Russo's The Real Twilight: True Stories of Modern Day Vampires was the first book I saw, and for £1.99 I thought it might be interesting to see just how far weird vamp-obsession can go. Cash, Johnny Cash's famous autobiography, was tucked under a heap of other books so I plucked that out as well. And just as we were about to leave, I spotted a hardcover copy of Karl Pilkington's An Idiot Abroad hidden behind a big display. I think he's hilarious but his books are usually so darn expensive, so £4.99 seemed a pretty good deal!"

If your client manages projects through Ouija boards and crayons, then so do you. We must learn to adapt and apply what we’ve learned as project managers to each client and each situation. As PM’s, we should never force feed. We must suggest, nurture, cajole – introduce slowly the project management concepts we know and love – and are enablers of success!.

"The leg movement, colloquially known as the “frog kick” or “whip kick”, consists of two phases: bringing the feet into position for the thrust phase and the insweep phase. From the initial position with the legs stretched out backward, the feet are moved together towards the posterior, while the knees stay together. The knees should not sink too low, as this increases the drag. Then the feet point outward in preparation for the thrust phase. In the thrust phase, the legs are moved elliptically back to the initial position. During this movement, the knees are kept together. The legs move slower while bringing the legs into position for the thrust phase, and move very fast during the thrust phase. Again, the goal is produce maximum thrust during the in sweep phase, and minimum drag during the recovery phase. In the recovery phase the lower leg and the feet are in the wake of the upper leg, and the feet are pointed to the rear. In the thrust phase all three parts create their own wake, and the flat end of the feet acts like a hydrofoil aligned to give maximum forward thrust. The resulting drag coefficient (or more precisely the frontal area) is thus doubled in the thrust phase."

"In this system, it's acceptable to let a 70 year old, die while giving care to a 25 year old, because their life is worth more to the collective - excuse me - worth more to society. To paraphrase their quote, ""it's not discrimination to deny care to the 70 year old and give it to the 25 year old. Everyone who is now 70 was once 25 and the majority of those who are 25 now will be 70 some day"". In other words, ""we can screw you now because we didn't screw you earlier; and if we're not screwing you now, wait until you're 70 and then you'll really be screwed."" The implications are obvious: if a twenty-something needs a liver or kidney transplant and a suitable donor person below 10 or over 50 (judging by Emanuel's chart) is available, these ethics standards say go ahead and kill the kid or kill the grandma and get the working ""unit"" back to work so ""it"" can make money and pay taxes to the mighty Fed.gov hydra."

"With just a tiny bit of prep during the weekend, a plate of delicious scrambled eggs is less than 5 minutes away. Seriously. You can time it. I’ll provide a recipe for you to try out, but really, the perfect weekday eggs are more of a method. When you have a little extra free time in the kitchen, pull out your food processor and puree some scramble-worthy vegetables and olive oil. I used a tomato, shallot, and parsley but I think mushrooms, zucchini, and/or spinach would be other good options. Store the concoction in the fridge and use it as the base for your scrambled eggs when you’re in a hurry. As a bonus, I found that this method yields consistently nice, soft scrambled eggs (as opposed to those dry, overcooked bits you might get when you’re rushing to get out the door and trying to multi-task…oops.) I’m not sure why this is, but I’ll take it."

Well, i was truly blessed to have met Line during my 2nd year at University and for the next 4 years, we were almost inseparable. She quickly became one of my dearest friends, my 'Partner in Crime' as we liked to call each other back then. Nowadays, we don't get to see each other or talk that often, but she will always hold a very special place in my heart and will always be at the top of the list, where best friends are concerned!"

As for me, whenever Vampires are the main characters of movies or novels I tend to get curious and want to know what it is all about. I was actually about to watch the Vampire Diaries Season 3 Ep 20 but this movie’s title caught my attention and I just had to check it out. I would have been so happy if it had been up to my expectations and even above but it wasn’t. Jasin, the leader of the Vampire coven/ brood is looking for who he is supposed to spend the rest of eternity with before his 101 birthday. He is torn between the gorgeous Tara, who is already open to the idea of becoming a Vampire and Caleb."

"Watching Alam on a hot March afternoon is a lesson in how the UID platform is fraught with uncertainties and shortcomings. The biggest problem is connectivity. There are two towers directly across the road from the Pragya Kendra in Tigara panchayat and a third is being erected in the vicinity. Yet, Alam is forced to make a round of the Kendra and finally move out towards the anganwadi before he is able to make contact with his bank server. “Connectivity is at the heart of this system.

But add to that the horrible idea of hiring Tim Burton to direct and you have a mess."
"to buildings with character, those rooted in America and that could chronicle many tales.

But I have to say that the center of Paris is my spiritual home. Probably the 2nd (or 1st) Arrondissement would still be my favorite spot. Beauty, history, convenience. Ah..."

"Besides the health, financial, and environmental reasons, there is of course the ethical reason. Is it correct that 70 Billion animals are raised each year only to become food for humans? The vast majority of these animals live lives of such unimaginable squalor and suffering as to dull the senses. There seems to be a widespread idea that animals, for some reason, don’t feel pain or suffering like humans, or that they only exist to feed humans. These are such juvenile ideas that they would almost be laughable if they weren’t so repugnant. Notwithstanding the active abuse dished out to untold numbers of animals and the horrible conditions that they inhabit during their short, sad lives, the worst part of this issue is the fact that most humans feel that there is nothing wrong in our very mentally which justifies the slavery and subservience of all other animals to our appetites and whims, and that humans are naturally superior and ordained to dominate and rule the earth because we are the most intelligent species. This is an example of an intelligence I want no part of. We are animals too, and this slavery and abuse is unacceptable and should not be tolerated or even allowed."

It is estimated that 53% of all people will have one or more affairs during their life time and that younger people are more likely candidates; in fact younger woman are just as likely as younger men to be unfaithful (womansavers.com). It breaks my heart to look at these statistics. The numbers have only been getting higher."
"Recently I took a little trip to New York city and I was doing something else I love to do. I was gazing at all the wonderful impressionist paintings at the Metropolitian Muesum of Art. As I was viewing one of Monet's water lilly paintings it occured to me it was all done in blues and violets.

"Springsteen often talks of a conversation he’s having with the fans. He repeatedly says he wants to continue that conversation—through recorded and live music. It’s more than a conversation. The editor of this collection gets it right: “In a very real sense, Springsteen’s body of work can also be viewed that way, as an ongoing exploration, via popular song, of the very heart of the American psyche.”"

My students knew my stance on it from the moment they entered my room. I also took great and carefully planned steps to build a solid classroom community the first two weeks of school. Curriculum was introduced, but it was always through the lens of community building. I wanted every single student to feel safe and important and part of the community of learners."

Another is the best WR recruit out of Georgia — Jason Croom. Alton “Pig” Howard is another tasty WR signee for at least his name alone. Is Wide Receiver U back?

"The man who has lived in this house for several years is the grandson of the farmer who built it, and it was passed down three generations to the degenerate who has let the thing go to hell. OK, to be fair, his mother wasn’t much better. When she owned the house, she would decorate the lawn for the seasons and then leave everything up all year—Christmas lights, a plywood cutout of Santa riding a rocket, a hay bale with pumpkins in various stages of decay, plastic Easter eggs hanging from the lower branches of the scraggly trees.

"Adoption specialists point out that adoptees often feel anger in response to being given away by birth parents, feeling like second class citizens, and feeling unworthy of having anything good happen to them. We must also stay mindful of the fact that many adoptees come from backgrounds where there is a family history of poor impulse control, psychiatric disorders, substance abuse, or other factors that can contribute to a poor modulation of emotions. Thus, when the child is angry, he may have little recognition or control over how intense his response is. Also, children who grew up in violent or chaotic environments had aggression and rage modeled for them and they quickly learn that it is an effective way of getting attention and perhaps even getting one’s needs met."

"On Nuclear issue too, how can the US and other “nuclear” nations preach nuclear abstinence to Iran when they themselves are armed to teeth with nuclear warheads, with a combined capacity to destroy the complete world at least 15 times over? (Well, one can die only once, sadly!) What legitimacy does all these nuclear nations have which gives them the moral-or-immoral authority to curb an independent nation’s nuclear ambitions when it is repeatedly proclaiming its peaceful intents? Even if the fact that Iran fought with Iraq for almost a decade but that does not make it a global threat! And by the way, we all know that both these neighboring countries were pitched against each other to neutralize each other and create a conflict zone in the Middle East to suit global arms dealers’ desires. Both Iran and Iraq got used and abused by the West, including the US. The intention was only one: to gain forever access to their huge Oil reserves in order to satiate their ever growing energy demands. Saudi Arabia, the world knew, was never going to be easy to target, anyway, and that is the reason it has never been eyed so far in spite of being the largest Oil producer."

"After breaking free from my somewhat sheltered and slightly ignorant small town country life I started working in a German owned automotive company. This came after I left a management position in a pharmacy chain in my bold attempt to explore new possibilities. It was humbling, because this job I went to was a production job, but they paid for my college. The production job was perfect for me, because there was no stress. I only had to work, which allowed me to save all my brain power for the college classes. The most valuable part of the experience was my introduction to new cultures. Of course Germans had a strong presence there, but many others as well. I made my first black friends there because the small town from which I came was 99.99% white. I made a few new Latin friends from Mexico and South America and a few Asian friends as well."

"Of course Kṛṣṇa was present to tell Arjuna what his work was, but what about us? Śrī Kṛṣṇa was personally directing Arjuna to act in such and such a way, but just because Kṛṣṇa is not personally present before us, we should not assume that there is no direction. Indeed, there is direction. In the last chapter of Bhagavad-gītā the proper work which we are to perform is given."

"It was one of those simple, perceptive questions that require a series of verbal gymnastics to answer in a way that is satisfactory to both parent and child. The full answer is that an equine ambulance doesn’t have lights or sirens because if a racehorse is so badly injured that it would need to be rushed to a hospital, it is usually put down – i.e. killed - right there at the track. But how do you explain to a four-year old that horses aren’t cared for in the same way as humans? We opted not to and instead decided that this ambulance was for getting a horse off the track and that a second ambulance – one with lights and sirens – would be used to take a horse to the necessary medical facility. Pip seemed satisfied with that."

"Oh yeah, back to the movie, how does all this EPR rambling tie in to the movie? Well, I really wish I had seen it when Eran Kolirin was still here, because I would've loved to quiz him about it. But I can say that festival programmer Rod Armstrong introduced the movie by saying in previous Q&A's some audience members wanted to ascribe mental health issues (anything from depression to schizophrenia) to the protagonist, and Eran was adamant that he's not crazy in any way. Well, that's easy for me--he's not crazy, he's just a physicist. And his class ends one day when he's right in the middle of discussing EPR. So he goes home with all this at the front of his mind, keenly aware he's collapsing Wave Functions all around him. Well, as a guy, what's the one thing that is most profound to collapse by observing. That's right, his own penis. So he takes a second, whips it out, and looks at it in the mirror. Then he notices another guy watching him. And wacky hijinx ensue."

No, ordinarily, I don’t buy boxed cereals for the boys. And I’m not sure how proud I am of the purchase.

"Oxford in Faulkner’s day was a quaint stop in the North Mississippi hill country on the Illinois Central Railroad line. Mainly, the Oxford stop was to move cotton and students around. A relatively new town by Eastern standards, Oxford as a white settlement goes back only to 1836, when Lafayette County was one of thirteen counties created by the state legislature. But before that, the area had been home to the Chickasaw and earlier groups for around twelve thousand years. In 1837, three men purchased fifty acres for a town from two Chickasaws, Hoka and E Ah Nah Yea, who no doubt saw the writing on the wall: The site was on the Trail of Tears, along which a year later Native Americans would be forced to leave their home and march westward."

"WWII is entering its last phase: Germany is in ruins, but does not yield. The US army lacks crucial knowledge about the German units operating on the opposite side of the Rhine, and decides to send two German prisoners to gather information.

"For instance, we learn that in the sixteenth century Conrad Dasypodius, a Swiss mathematician, could have chosen to restore the old Clock of the Three Kings in Strasbourg Cathedral. Dasypodius, however, preferred to build a new clock of his own rather than maintain an old one. Over two centuries later, Jean-Baptiste Schwilgue was asked to repair the clock built by Dasypodius, but he decided to build a new and better clock which would last for 10,000 years."

"Adoption specialists point out that adoptees often feel anger in response to being given away by birth parents, feeling like second class citizens, and feeling unworthy of having anything good happen to them. We must also stay mindful of the fact that many adoptees come from backgrounds where there is a family history of poor impulse control, psychiatric disorders, substance abuse, or other factors that can contribute to a poor modulation of emotions. Thus, when the child is angry, he may have little recognition or control over how intense his response is. Also, children who grew up in violent or chaotic environments had aggression and rage modeled for them and they quickly learn that it is an effective way of getting attention and perhaps even getting one’s needs met."

"The movie shoot, filmed on the Kennish property, looks pretty nifty for something thrown together in a week. Regina seems a little taken aback by the money being spent, with props, make-up, wind, and smoke machines. Daphne is also a little reserved, but it’s clear she’s noticing little things around the house that reflect the childhood she didn’t have, such as Bay and Toby’s handprints in a garden stone. Filming is set to begin, but Toby can’t figure out how to work the borrowed (from Simone/Buckner) video equipment, so Simone is brought in to shoot the movie. Emmett and Simone play off barely knowing each other, but he texts her to leave (since she doesn’t know sign).

"The negativity that results from this line of argument can be qualified by way of Noys’ excellent introduction, which describes affirmationism’s emergence from two prior theoretical trends. The first of these trends is a nihilistic, post-1968 tendency to align emancipatory potential with the unleashing of capital flows (linked to the early 1970′s work of Baudrillard, Deleuze and Lyotard); but having been rendered untenable by the realities of 1980′s neo-liberalism, this is said to have given rise to a subsequent interest in linking opposition to transcendence, difference, and otherness. Affirmationism’s concerns with immanent, but also oppositional forms synthesised these two tendencies, and Noys shares its consequent avoidance of associating oppositional negativity with either immanence or transcendence: he contends that a focus on the generation of immanent difference would echo the operation of real abstraction, whilst transcendent externality mirrors the ‘void’ of abstract value itself. His account of negativity as ‘immanent rupture’ (17) is not associated with either pole: it is ‘internal’ (128) to the positivity that it contests, but it exists in a ‘relation of rupture’ (172) with it."

And allowing for business losses to be carried backwards as well as forwards is both innovative and potentially very helpful to business. And lifting the tax-free threshold was WAY overdue."

"This was a surmountable operational difficulty presented by the linguistic differences between people who were visually indistinguishable. But when we consider the nature of our Muslim Troubles, we see immediately that operating undercover in this fashion is not going to be possible to any significant extent. Nearly all of the Muslims in the UK are something other than white, and nearly everyone in the British army is white. This means that putting together a Det-style army unit to go and prowl around in Muslim areas will be impossible, as there will be no significant pool of suitable people in the army to recruit from for the purpose. It will surely not be beyond the ken of Muslims to see that mysterious white converts to Islam who start coming into their areas may not be exactly what they seem. This is what we will call the mutual impermeability problem, a problem which will bedevil the efforts of all parties to the conflict one way or another. It will be one of the biggest and most significant differences between the Troubles and our forthcoming Muslim Troubles."

But perhaps they do have their uses. Macabre as is sounds, they helped Thomas, and Jesus offered him exactly what he wanted – to put his hand in his nail marks and in his side. Perhaps, believing in the resurrection, even our scars become part of our sending."

"Apparently there is no need to discover if allegations are true nowadays. Just the fact that someone has been accused by anonymous sources is enough to convict - at least in the press. So much for innocent until proven guilty. Proof of a settlement is no proof at all, particularly when it comes to sexual harassment allegations. It is routine for large companies to pay off on claims like this as it is far cheaper (even at $45,000) than investigating and defending a suit. Ultimately, a southern man - particularly of a certain age - calling someone 'darling' is as much sexual harassment as Brigadier General Michael Walsh's calling Senator Barbara Boxer 'ma'am' was an attempt to somehow demean her. Ridiculous."
"A strange thing happened to me in between the first season of Laid and this second season premiere – I grew fonder of the show. This doesn’t mean my opinion of the first season changed; I still think of it as a drippy, one-note, trying-too-hard dramedy, but I did find myself strangely looking forward to the new season because of two key cast members. Let’s place the blame for this at the feet of The Little Dum Dum Club, a hilarious podcast hosted by Karl Chandler and Tommy Dassalo where each episode they invite a comic into the studio for a chat. Celia Pacquola has been on the show once by herself and once with her boyfriend, and Laid co-star, Toby Truslove and both of them were very funny and delightful and I liked them so much I was half-convinced the second season of Laid might be better. While this episode doesn’t come across as self-satisfied as the show did in its first season, a lot of the things that didn’t work the first time around still don’t work the second time around."

"In the New Testament, the word used for “spirit” is pneuma; however, Paul in First Corinthians 15:44 used the words: soma pneuma (“σωμα πνευματικον”) which means “spiritual body”. This is the type of body that we, as believers in Jesus, will also be raised with. A week after Jesus had resurrected, Scripture says he was still around for at least one week before his ascension (John 20:26). The resurrected Jesus walked around, made himself known to many people, and he showed himself in a resurrected spiritual-physical body to over 500 people. He was definitely not in hiding. The bible is clear about the form of Jesus’ resurrected body. The onus is on doubters to disprove that Jesus resurrected in a physical-spiritual body."
"Professor Hazard himself used to practice the discipline of homeopathy but has now deferred to complementary medicines. He has accused professionals in the field of “cherry-picking” results in order to suit themselves in order to prove that the treatments work. The Department of Health were clear in their opinion that patients should be given the choices about their treatments, including homeopathy, and the actual figure suggests that only 0.001 per cent of the budget is spent on these types of treatment."

"Let me hit you with a few statistics. Did you know that 60% of men and 40% of women will have an affair at some point in their marriage? It is estimated that 53% of all people will have one or more affairs during their life time and that younger people are more likely candidates; in fact younger woman are just as likely as younger men to be unfaithful (womansavers.com). It breaks my heart to look at these statistics. The numbers have only been getting higher."

"I’m sure none of you have ever heard of this movie or that even if you have, you most likely did not bother to watch it. As for me, whenever Vampires are the main characters of movies or novels I tend to get curious and want to know what it is all about. I was actually about to watch the Vampire Diaries Season 3 Ep 20 but this movie’s title caught my attention and I just had to check it out. I would have been so happy if it had been up to my expectations and even above but it wasn’t. Jasin, the leader of the Vampire coven/ brood is looking for who he is supposed to spend the rest of eternity with before his 101 birthday. He is torn between the gorgeous Tara, who is already open to the idea of becoming a Vampire and Caleb."

"I wanted to pass on an email I received from Focus On The Family. We are living in troubled times and as much as I hate to admit this, I believe that we as the Church have invited this upon ourselves by placing evil or ungodly men in positions of governmental power and influence who have used their positions of influence to enact laws that now threaten families and especially the safety of our own children. Without getting political, let me say that your voice matters and the fact that we have not supported Born Again governmental leaders or demanded that the ungodly follow Biblical principles in leading our nation has brought us to the kind of problems echoed in this troubling report.

Construction paper soaks up glue and things are never quite even. Believe it or not, 4th graders STILL don't know how to use bottled glue!!!!!

"It was one of those simple, perceptive questions that require a series of verbal gymnastics to answer in a way that is satisfactory to both parent and child. The full answer is that an equine ambulance doesn’t have lights or sirens because if a racehorse is so badly injured that it would need to be rushed to a hospital, it is usually put down – i.e. killed - right there at the track. But how do you explain to a four-year old that horses aren’t cared for in the same way as humans? We opted not to and instead decided that this ambulance was for getting a horse off the track and that a second ambulance – one with lights and sirens – would be used to take a horse to the necessary medical facility. Pip seemed satisfied with that."

He had a difficult personality that kept getting in his way. He was fired from the 1925 Ziegfeld revue No Foolin’ for mouthing off to the boss.

Yes she isn't as tough as Rose but as the story progresses we see how she begins to become her own person. At the end of VA Sydney was in trouble with the Alchemists for helping Rose escape so we see how she still treads lightly around them but will do anything to get back in their good graces."

"“Farther Away” begins with Franzen going to an isolated island to do some bird watching and be alone in nature. He takes along Robinson Crusoe is sets off in search of a rare bird species, planning to eschew most modern conveniences, read the book, and write about the solitary experiences. He also plans to spread some of Wallace’s ashes on the island, imagining his friend would love his ashes being spread on a beautiful island that’s hard to get to. As Franzen fights a losing battle with nature, he begins to process some of of the grief and anger that he’s held at bay in the years since his friend’s death. I was stunned by the power of his words and by his brutal insights into Wallace’s suicide. SPOILER ALERT:"
"“Yet again there has been a complete overreaction which in fact will put ordinary people at greater risk than any extremely unlikely external attack,” one letter in the left-leaning Guardian newspaper said."
"The first and most significant for traditional Christians who are sacramentally oriented, will be the Eucharist. In the Eucharist, Christ is supposed to transport the communicant to the event of calvary, along with the resurrection, and more broadly the creation of the world along with the eschaton. In the Eucharist, the communicant is re-presented with Christ himself, making both past events and future events really present realities. This poses a problem, however, if events in the future are in no sense real, which is what the A theorist is committed to. Although perhaps God could somehow re-present what was in the past as present, he could not present us with what is in the future, and is in no sense real. Imagine how the Eucharist at the Last supper looks if we admit that Christ had in no sense yet died for his Church."

Burek posted a really sweet video guide to using Force Push yesterday. So that was fresh on my mind. Now, I have a pretty regular rotation that I use. Force Push is in it, but it’s buried pretty deep and typically only gets used on elites because everything else dies before I get to it, except for random occasions when I use it as an interrupt. I learned some pretty cool things from the video, but there are other things to keep in mind when using it in PvE. Here are a couple:"

Razor sharp guitars, searing torches including acoustic guitars. ""No Dreams"" lays out an agenda that would loom large in Bator's next band. The rest of the album runs similarly bleak. Without a doubt, ""Ready To Snap"" is the highlight of the album and is a battle cry to commence the boot boys to teenage war. The sophistication of this work has never been properly honored, seems to have never hit,, bellowing over the heads of many a punk."

"Apparently there is no need to discover if allegations are true nowadays. Just the fact that someone has been accused by anonymous sources is enough to convict - at least in the press. So much for innocent until proven guilty. Proof of a settlement is no proof at all, particularly when it comes to sexual harassment allegations. It is routine for large companies to pay off on claims like this as it is far cheaper (even at $45,000) than investigating and defending a suit. Ultimately, a southern man - particularly of a certain age - calling someone 'darling' is as much sexual harassment as Brigadier General Michael Walsh's calling Senator Barbara Boxer 'ma'am' was an attempt to somehow demean her.

"Hello. I am from Edinburgh, live now in Caithness in the far north in a house next to the beach and have always, in different ways, worked with words. I was a journalist but soon realised that didn’t match the dream I nurtured of ‘being a writer.’ I did the travelling thing – wonderful adventures in Greece, Turkey, Israel and working on a yacht on the Mediterranean. I studied speech and drama, specialised in voice work and taught for a good while. Immersing myself in other people’s words was an excellent apprenticeship. I also became involved with the world of storytelling – so poetry, drama, stories – and speaking poetry, feeling the sounds and rhythms, aiming to bring the images in poems and stories to life – that has been my work for twenty years. I also took an MA in creative writing and personal development from the University of Sussex. I am also lucky to come from an artistic family. My aunt Helen started the Craigmillar Festival Society and as I was growing up that, and the annual inspiration of the Edinburgh Festival, all showed me that creativity and art helps set people free. I live with my lovely partner, our dog Flora and clucking hens."

"But it is too simplistic to claim that government support is the only reason China has had some B2B success. The strength of the country’s scientific and technical talent is growing, and local companies increasingly bring real capabilities to the table. What’s more, a number of government-supported innovation efforts have not been successful. Some notable examples include attempts to develop an indigenous 3G telecommunications protocol called TDS-CDMA and to replace the global Wi-Fi standard with a China-only Internet security protocol, WAPI."

"The scanner barely picks them up. In fact, I had to run a scan at 600 DPI to get them to show! You can see from the scan that there was no feathering or shadowing with any of the pens I used, and the Lumocolor is the only that bled. And the Lumocolor bleeds through most paper."

"Tangrams are another fun alternative. I found a Powerpoint version of Grandfather Tang's Story my first year teaching (and did not own the book yet). I liked it because it could then be projected and was entertaining for the kids to watch. I do not recall where it came from any longer, but here is a link to the copy I have...as well as tangram picture mats for the kids to try to make."

"What a crazy, wild ride this thing called life can be! This may sound corny, but I think it’s so important to make a list-either physical or mental-about the blessings in your life from time to time. Sometimes we’re too busy feeling sorry for ourselves to realize how good we really have it. And I want to add all my blog readers onto my list of blessings! Thank you just for being you!"
"Hence the blog in January 2010. My main goal was to find a new creative passion. I wasn't planning on quitting my job. I wasn't planning on traveling the world. I was just hoping to find some pleasure in my life."
"Coats, who studied Ancient History and Classics at university, says her interest in Greek mythology began at a young age. “From the age of about eight I read everything I could get my hands on and that has stayed with me. I love the fact that the myths can be endlessly recycled and told in different ways. If I am writing a contemporary story, I can take a character or two from the myths, adapt them and make their stories relevant to today.”"

"First I printed a full 12 x 12 using the pink circle pattern from Nursery Tails cart. Then using the print only feature I filled the Valentine word collage with red and printed it at 9.5""."
"As a runner, I am the same way. When things are going well and I am oh so happy about life, I do not run as fast and I do not push myself. I just jog along in la-la land noticing the flowers and birds chirping. I have trouble pushing myself to run hard and would rather lay in the grass making flower crowns for my head and do some cartwheels while I am at it."
"In the mean time, all of my worldly possessions are being put into boxes by four nice young men, led by a lovely gentleman who sounds a bit like Larry the Cable Guy. They will cart it all away tomorrow, leaving us to wend our way Southward, and if we're lucky they'll give it all back a week from now. And then all the things that took them a day to pack will take me 3+ months to unpack***, something which makes me rather sad."

"Since starting Baclofen I am finding that I am much more able to just ‘be’ and live in the moment. I think that’s why I am much more productive now – at work and in personal time. Because I’m focusing on one task at a time, and not having ten things on the go simultaneously, I am getting through so much more."
"Update: Since posting, I've received some emails for 15% off blog books. Darn I missed out on saving an additional 5% but you can! I would recommend signing up for both Blog 2 Print and Cutest Blog on the Book emails since I received one email that advertised 10% off and another that advertised 15% off at the same time and for the exact same service."
"The UK’s budget deficit ballooned by 50% in March, to £18.2bn from £12.bn in February. Year-on-year, it is still very slightly up. In the fiscal year through March, spending rose by 2% thanks to the government’s alleged “programme of cuts”."

"Now it is considered abnormal to not have a smart phone or a facebook page or a twitter account. The systems in place to see those products and narratives into your hands and at your constant disposal take up more resources than they put back in to the world. Any critique of these systems of mass communication is mostly greeted with a blank stare and a saddened frown. At its worst, the reaction can be openly hostile and personally aggressive. You’re holding up the line, asshole."
"And it's such a mess. So unfair. And dare I say it, so selfish. But maybe it's just as selfish to think I could have made any real difference. I don't know."
"Roses also used as a simple token of affection and love of a man to a women so it's is very useful in a man courting a woman who wanted to win the heart of the woman...I remember my hubby always gave me a bunch of white roses and he succeeded...maybe because he gave me white roses he told me that is a symbol of pure intentions of love and I believed in him until now."
"He showed me that He alone wants all of the glory and this is also for our highest good!"
"The first EP, The Serpentine Similar (Dexter's Cigar, 1993), with the collaboration of John McEntire, is a deeply experimental record. Apart from a few scant touches by McEntire on percussion, the tracks are arranged for guitar and bass only or for piano and bass (in rare exceptions voice too). What sets this music apart isn't so much its bare arrangements, but rather the ambiguous incongruities in its harmony."
"Problem is, where does that leave inner city kids who don’t have the ways or the means to get out and see nature — much less to contemplate its beauty?"
"P.S. I have had several requests to post more pictures of cakes, so I have listened and I am happy to share. This was the birthday cake I made for my Mom last month. The cake details are listed below:"
"NCHS appears to have solved the problem and now everyone who dies can be placed in an acceptable category. Since each death involves a heart that stops beating, deaths for ‘unknown’ reasons have become deaths from ‘heart attacks.’"
"I pick my toast up. I love toast. Mom. I love my toast. Mom. I love you toast. Mom. I eat my toast, ham and potatoes and then I get applesauce? I eat applesauce, swig milk and find piece for Al's bike in no time? Where my...my...my...my...my flashlight? It's a kid's flashlight. It's a toy flashlight. You find it for me? You find it for me? Mom. I go in ga'age and find piece for Al's bike in no time, right?! I love you toast, Mom."
"All this would seem surreal except, last night, I went to the Pull The Other One comedy club and saw the former Frank Sanazi (sings like Sinatra; looks like Hitler) appear as orange-faced Tom Jones soundalike Tom Mones and Martin Soan appeared briefly as Miss Haversham from Great Expectations sitting in a chair. His costume included the chair. You had to be there. Allegedly the costume took a year to make. He was on stage for perhaps two minutes."

"Obama to mainstream media at last year’s White House Correspondence Dinner: “I am Barack Obama. Most of you covered me. ALL of you voted for me.” And their response was to laugh because it was true and they all knew it was true and it is by now obvious to anyone with more brains than a jellyfish that it’s true. Well, that and the fact that Dear Leader told a funny and all journalists are required to laugh whenever Messiah tells a funny."

"Borrowed - Blue ink used to dull down the blue of the title lettering."
"Of course, most practising vampires drain the life from an unblood once in a while, but most make sure they have a careful balance between kills and the safer consumption of vampire blood. After all, in terms of quality the taste of vampire blood is generally more satisfying, more complex and bolder in its flavour than that of a normal, unconverted human being. And the most delicious blood of all, the Pinot Rouge every blood lover knows is the best on offer, is the blood taken from someone’s veins the moment after conversion."
"Sometimes I have a vision of the very last scene, and I write to find out how the characters got to that point. Other times I have a character and an opening, and I write to find out what happens next. The story starts to unfold and, with luck, layer."
"3 medium potatoes, peeled,"
"Yes, I know smoking was bad for me, and that I gave up before the hacking cough and health problems kicked in. I gave up before I reached 40, so I remember all the pleasure cigarettes give the young but none of the downsides, which show themselves later on in life. However, for all the wonders of the world He created, it is surely evidence of a somewhat perverse sense of humour on the part of the maker that so much in life which gives you pleasure, is either bad for you, or makes you fat. There are surely few experiences more dismal than an entirely healthy lifestyle, and that seems rather unfair."

"Not having a piece of paper, which does limit jobs to some (debatable) extent (though if I chose to, I could study and get a piece of paper, so I'm not sure how much of a downside this is...)."
"The movie shoot, filmed on the Kennish property, looks pretty nifty for something thrown together in a week. Regina seems a little taken aback by the money being spent, with props, make-up, wind, and smoke machines. Daphne is also a little reserved, but it’s clear she’s noticing little things around the house that reflect the childhood she didn’t have, such as Bay and Toby’s handprints in a garden stone. Filming is set to begin, but Toby can’t figure out how to work the borrowed (from Simone/Buckner) video equipment, so Simone is brought in to shoot the movie. Emmett and Simone play off barely knowing each other, but he texts her to leave (since she doesn’t know sign). I wonder when the two exchanged phone numbers and why they programmed each other in their cells since they’re “not supposed to know each other”?"

"By 1949 the anti-comics hysteria wanes a bit and publishers begin to leave the ACMP. Timely may have left early on but at some point must have returned as their covers sported a small ACMP stamp from April 1952 to January 1955 on most titles."

"I passed it by half-a-dozen times before my curiosity got the better of me and I decided to give it a chance. As much as I’ve been addicted to Murder She Wrote, I really wasn’t expecting much from A Green Journey—But I was in a Hallmark/Lifetime-movie-of-the-week kind of mood, so it was well-suited."
"We had a new central air unit put in, today (replaced our old one). The guy in charge (co-owner of the small outfit selling the unit and doing the work) was incredibly pleased that we cut them a check for the full amount owed before he left. The two younger guys he had doing the real grunt work were incredibly pleased with the pieces of chocolate cake (made fresh last night) I sent with them--possibly more than if we'd given them cash tips."
"In this respect, sinister role of Indian RAW could also be judged from some other events of sectarian violence. In 2008, in Khyber Agency, intermittent fighting between Lashkar-e-Islam and Ansar-ul-Islam had claimed as many as 1500 lives. Lashkar Islami is led by fanatic cleric Mangal Bagh who follows the puritanical Deobandi form of Sunni Islam and has close connections with the extremist Taliban of Afghanistan. Besides other areas of Pakistan, more than 2000 people died in sectarian riots in Kurram Agency, bordering Afghanistan. Its areas have been hit by fierce clashes, pitching Sunni Muslims against the minority Shias. A number of ceasefires was concluded between the warring sects with the help of government officials and the tribal Maliks, but the same proved fruitless owing to the support from Afghanistan where more than hundred training centers covertly established by RAW are supervising anti-Pakistan activities with the tactical help CIA and Mossad."

"I’m sure none of you have ever heard of this movie or that even if you have, you most likely did not bother to watch it. As for me, whenever Vampires are the main characters of movies or novels I tend to get curious and want to know what it is all about. I was actually about to watch the Vampire Diaries Season 3 Ep 20 but this movie’s title caught my attention and I just had to check it out. I would have been so happy if it had been up to my expectations and even above but it wasn’t. Jasin, the leader of the Vampire coven/ brood is looking for who he is supposed to spend the rest of eternity with before his 101 birthday. He is torn between the gorgeous Tara, who is already open to the idea of becoming a Vampire and Caleb."
"It’s not a time to think, what else could I be eating for more variety or mouth happiness? And eating any off-product food during Phase 1 can be a slippery slope. Like the person I mentioned in an earlier post who assumed that cream and sugar were fine since coffee was allowed, there could be someone who assumed that (high-cal, high-fat) dressing was OK with a plain lettuce salad. Not everyone is calorie knowledgeable, and in Phase 1 we don’t count calories."
"Processed foods like deli meats contain a lot of sodium, which can interrupt sleep by raising your blood pressure and dehydrating you, Cornell’s Maas says. Caffeine, meanwhile, stays in your system for up to 12 hours, so the effects of a p.m. latte could linger till midnight. Try skipping the joe tomorrow: Not having caffeine for a single day can improve sleep quality that night, a study in the Journal of Clinical Nursing found."

"In Iraq, Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki has touted his success in thwarting Washington's belated (and halfhearted) efforts to keep a significant number of U.S. forces in his country after the end of this year. His coalition partner and fellow Iranian cat's paw, Muqtada al-Sadr, already is boasting that he also will drive out the American contractor personnel who are, for the moment, expected to provide a measure of security after the military withdraws. In that case, we may well see the mullahs' agents take over a U.S. embassy for the second time since 1979 - this one the newest, largest and most expensive in the world."

"The last time Mercury was retrograde directly opposite your sign was in September 2009. This is always an indication that you have to face old issues with partners, especially ex-partners. It could mean you are similarly dealing with old issues with close friends as well. Whatever the case, all this stuff is back on your plate again. Oy! The downside of Mercury is feeling frustrated with delays. But the upside of Mercury (and incredibly, there is an upside) is that you can quite easily expedite things or finish things or bring them to a conclusion now. Wouldn't it be nice to get rid of this once and for all? Some of you, however, are not dealing with old issues. You're just running into ex-partners -- and all that that implies. (Yikes!)"

"Duncan Hines' website has pretty good instructions on how to put them together. You can find them here. The best tip, I felt, was microwaving the Oreos a few seconds to soften them so they would separate easier. When I separated them, however, I wasn't entirely successful in keeping all, or even most, of the cream on one side. I used a small off-set spatula to carefully scrape the cream off one side of the cookie and put it on the other side that had the majority of the cream filling. Then, using that spatula (having the small off-set spatula ~ you know, the kind for smoothing frosting on cakes, cupcakes ~ really made this job easy) I smoothed the cream as best as possible."

"AYR: Maybe somewhat presumptuous, but worth asking, especially since others have raised the question to me. Still, I'll acknowledge that the Post has kept a reasonably long leash.

"WWII is entering its last phase: Germany is in ruins, but does not yield. The US army lacks crucial knowledge about the German units operating on the opposite side of the Rhine, and decides to send two German prisoners to gather information. The scheme is risky: the Gestapo retains a terribly efficient network to identify and capture spies and deserters. Moreover, it is not clear that “Tiger”, who does not mind any dirty work as long as the price is right, and war-weary “Happy”, who might be easily betrayed by his feelings, are dependable agents. After Tiger and another American agent are successfully infiltrated, Happy is parachuted in Bavaria. His duty: find out the whereabouts of a powerful German armored unit moving towards the western front."

"I have always thought in three dimensions (I can’t draw for toffee and have much admiration for those who can), and having worked on and off with polymer clay for years, I decided to turn my full attention to that medium and see what happened. To say that I was rather surprised by the outpouring of wee creatures which happened as a result is something of an understatement. Now I am completely hooked on polymer clay – it is the most versatile material, and there is no limit to what you can achieve with it. It’s like painting with clay."
"Besides achieving a PB, I wanted to finish the race injury-free as well. However, I didn't manage to do any pre-race stretching due to the delay at the bag deposit counter. That got me worried. There was nothing that I could do, but to listen to my body with every stride."

"The other members of the Crustacea class display “the refracting type eye structure,” which works on completely different principles from those of the reflecting type. Here, the eye is made up of hundreds of cells like a honeycomb. Unlike the square cells in a lobster eye, these cells are either hexagonal or round. Furthermore, instead of reflecting light, small lenses in the cells refract the light onto the focus on the retina."
"When I take the stage on April 14th, it will be two years exactly, nearly to the hour that I took a ride to Lousisanna in a taxi cab to the mental hospital. In less than two years I have really began putting a nice life together for myself. I want to sing because I have some unfinished business. I am singing a song that I learned over 20 years ago but never sang it. I have many friends from recovery who been so constantly supportive about me growing as a spirit in human form that I can't wait to show them a little of what one part of my life, or one of my man LIVES was like. They have pulled the creativity back out in me. I'll post a video of the show here when I get one."

In an ideal world we would all like our teams to build cars that look nice at the same time as ‘going like stink’ and maybe McLaren are the team, so far, that have managed this but given a choice between a pretty car or one that is going to go faster, as a F1 fan, I would want the faster car! If this style of nose helps Ferrari, Force India and Caterham to improve their chances within the race then ‘bring on the ugly noses’ is what I say!"
"Hello. I am from Edinburgh, live now in Caithness in the far north in a house next to the beach and have always, in different ways, worked with words. I was a journalist but soon realised that didn’t match the dream I nurtured of ‘being a writer.’ I did the travelling thing – wonderful adventures in Greece, Turkey, Israel and working on a yacht on the Mediterranean. I studied speech and drama, specialised in voice work and taught for a good while. Immersing myself in other people’s words was an excellent apprenticeship. I also became involved with the world of storytelling – so poetry, drama, stories – and speaking poetry, feeling the sounds and rhythms, aiming to bring the images in poems and stories to life – that has been my work for twenty years. I also took an MA in creative writing and personal development from the University of Sussex. I am also lucky to come from an artistic family. My aunt Helen started the Craigmillar Festival Society and as I was growing up that, and the annual inspiration of the Edinburgh Festival, all showed me that creativity and art helps set people free. I live with my lovely partner, our dog Flora and clucking hens."
"So I wasn't surprised when I got up early that Sunday morning to drive home that there was fog.

"Even a multitrillion-dollar package of spending cuts and tax increases would not have stopped the red ink. At best, the grand bargain being sought would have shaved about $4 trillion from deficits expected to total at least $8 trillion over the next 10 years. But it could have changed the storyline of the nation’s politics, if not its government. Obama would have been able to run for a second term claiming bipartisan success at fiscal restraint, a boast he hoped would help erase or at least blur the image of him as a tax-and-spend liberal."

As you read books like The 2020 Workplace, Bridging the Boomer-Xer Gap, Generations at Work and similar titles, the authors use the differences between the generations to talk about their skills and weaknesses as groups, and how to take advantage of the skills and overcome the weaknesses."

"How can so many people be so INSANE? Marmite is disgusting! It's been banned in some countries, but that just drives it underground (I myslef, so my shame, have smuggled in pots for friends abroad who've been converted to the stuff, but because I love them, I do it). Governments are waking up to the evil of Marmite, but I don't think it's a war that can ever be one. If only there was a way of recognising Marmite lovers, then it might be easier. You know, we could get them to wear special badges, or round them up and get them to live in certain areas so we could keep an eye on them and make sure they don't spread their vile Marmite love. Surely we have a duty to protect our children from Marmite?"

"Before His denial, Peter had asserted that even if all others denied Christ, he would not. So Jesus begins by asking that question — “do you love Me more than these?” A humbled Peter drops the comparison and simply asserts, “Yes, Lord, you know that I love you.” So Jesus presses further, “Do you love Me?” That is, “Do you? Do you really love in the way that you say you do?” And Peter asserts that he not only loves Jesus, but that Jesus knows that he does. One final time Jesus asks, “Do you love Me?” The force of this seems to be, “Peter, as you reflect on your inward desires and passions, do you really love Me?” Peter was grieved over this third question, perhaps because it reminded him of his denials and perhaps because it had to be asked three times, but he responds, “Lord, you know all things. You know that I love you.” In this final affirmation he is just as emphatic as he was in his final denial in which he invoked the curses of God (Mt. 26:74). Yes, he loves Christ."

I do have an anxiety disorder (generalized, if you were curious), but it has nothing to do with my shyness. My shyness is this: I don’t like meeting new people, I don’t like talking in front of groups, but I also don’t have Social Anxiety Disorder. I get nervous, but I don’t really avoid those situations, and I can overcome that nervousness. It can be unpleasant talking to new people or in front of groups, but it can also go well."

"What unfortunately follows is – with the software application acting as a security blanket of project management commitment – true PM techniques and principles are often never learned (nor the application, mind you). Firms utilize the “accidental project management” approach, throw a few activities into an .mpp file, and focus much of their effort on the maximizing the practice of “project management by powerpoint” As a consultant, the most important thing to remember is this – Project Management is in the eye of the beholder (no matter what PMI or PRINCE2 or any other BOK may say.) If your client manages projects through Ouija boards and crayons, then so do you. We must learn to adapt and apply what we’ve learned as project managers to each client and each situation. As PM’s, we should never force feed. We must suggest, nurture, cajole – introduce slowly the project management concepts we know and love – and are enablers of success!. After all, they hired us to be project managers, right?"

We are living in troubled times and as much as I hate to admit this, I believe that we as the Church have invited this upon ourselves by placing evil or ungodly men in positions of governmental power and influence who have used their positions of influence to enact laws that now threaten families and especially the safety of our own children. Without getting political, let me say that your voice matters and the fact that we have not supported Born Again governmental leaders or demanded that the ungodly follow Biblical principles in leading our nation has brought us to the kind of problems echoed in this troubling report.

I have talked with some younger Druzes from the Golan, who told me that their generation felt more connected to Israel, though the older generation wanted to return to Syria. That was some years ago though and I don’t know how it is today, though I don’t think it has changed that much."

ESDC's continuing use of the 10 year build-out was supported—albeit, in this court’s opinion, only minimally—by the factors articulated by ESDC. ESDC did not, for reasons that are unexplained to this date, expressly state, in the documentation prepared in connection with its review of the 2009 plan, that the MTA agreement permitted FCRC to defer acquisition until 2030 of air rights necessary to complete construction of various buildings called for in Phase II of the Project. Contrary to petitioners’ contention, however, the documentation of ESDC’s review unquestionably demonstrates, as found above, that ESDC categorized the MTA agreement as a “major change” to the Project… and was aware of the MTA installment through 2030."

"The plants need a lot of caring and nurturing for them to grow right. Watering them morning and afternoon, cultivating the soil and checking them regularly are some ways to help the plants grow. For the garden to come into completion, one should not just plant and wait doing nothing. Same is true with our lives, we all have dreams and things that we want to accomplish, but we will not see them turn into reality if we just wait and do nothing. We have to make steps for them to be fulfilled. Planning without right implementation produces nothing. Nurture and do things that add-up to the realization of the vision."

"So that’s the main thing I remember about that film. And then, of course, it was a disaster when it came out - and almost immediately it also turned into a cult film – and it still is! Frankly, I don’t quite understand why – except that there’s no movie remotely like it. I saw it again a little over 10 years ago at a film festival in Dallas. They wanted me to come down because they couldn’t get anyone else so I went. And the category it was in was called “Films We Love to Hate”. And I thought wait a minute, they didn’t tell me that! And then I was interviewed in front of an audience at a midnight showing. They were asking me about Otto Preminger. And I said he was one of the great film directors and everybody laughed out loud. Then I started to list a number of movies that are remarkable and have some range. And at every one I said, they would laugh. “Wait a minute,” I said, “This is not being fair.” “Yeah, but Skidoo - we hear it’s terrible.” And I said, “Every film director who’s made a lot of movies has made a couple that don’t work – and by the way Skidoo does have a following.” So then I settled down with them to watch the film and I was like, “Oh God, it is terrible. It’s awful.” He was trying for something original and unusual – and he was challenging himself – but he didn’t know how to do it. It just wasn’t his thing."

"Anyhoo, long story short, lots and lots of blacks in my last neighborhood. Like, every other house. So I was jogging in one of the tonier areas of my neighborhood and there are two dogs in the front yard of this one house. They went after me like I was made out of ham. All I got was a tiny nip on the ankle. They weren’t large dogs, but they were large enough to put a scare in me. Scared, angry me stood in the middle of the street, kind of paralyzed, screaming for the home owners to get their fucking dogs. A large black man comes out of the house behind me. I snippily ask if these are his dogs. He patiently says “No.” and proceeds to clear the way for me. The dogs are intimidated by his height and decidedly not-defensive posture. They slunk away. I offered an effusive “Thank you, Sir!” and continued jogging home. I was shaken. But felt extraordinarily grateful for the nice, big, calm guy who came to my rescue. More big black guys for my neighborhood, please."

He is an adorable, funny, smart, witty, silly, and happy little boy (I can't say baby anymore:( On Thursday (2/23/12) he got ear tubes put in his ears because of chronic ear infections and fluid stuck in his ears which meant his ear drums weren't working correctly. The pictures in this post capture Ethan's attitude and personality as well as the morning. We thought maybe he would be crabby because he couldn't eat until after the surgery, but nope... he was a happy little boy the whole morning"

"Boscoe learned very well, so well that he was always the model for the other dogs in the class, but then Boscoe was a Border collie and would have learned well no matter what. I picture Border collies in the wild, feral Border collies, sitting politely and heeling and coming when called and not wolfing their food and doing the dishes immediately after eating and never leaving the house without first making their beds."
"The Southern Bridal Expo is scheduled for this weekend. R and I are meeting up with my best friend (and MOH) to check out the vendors and maybe get a few ideas. We are also going to visit a few bridal shops to look at bridesmaid dresses. I'm looking for something pink, maybe in a flowy chiffon fabric. My MOH went last weekend and tried on several dresses so I could get an idea of whats available and one of them was adorable. I can definitely imagine it alongside my dress."

"Far from the menace suggested by Allan Stratton's title, The Grave Robber's Apprentice is merely the occupation which an infant boy, retrieved from a jewelled chest awash on the shore, is anticipated to fill by his rescuer, Knobbe, a grave robber. After twelve years, Hans knows very little about himself, except that he does not want to be a grave robber. On the other hand, Angela, the twelve-year-old daughter of the Count and Countess von Schwanenberg knows that she wants to write and perform her marionette plays in all the courts of Europe. But, when Archduke Arnulf decides that Angela will become his next archduchess upon her thirteenth birthday, their lives take an unexpected turn."
"This novel is written in a very poetic and thoughtful way. I was drawn to the book as soon as I read the summary of the story. I have always loved historical fiction, but most of the novels I tend to read take place in England. This was a nice change, since it is set in France and actually features the famous French author, Victor Hugo! In fact, this tale is about Hugo’s wife having an affair on him—a situation which actually happened in real life."

"The thing is If we’re all playing the game then surely the oke is sussed enough to come to the conclusion that you’re not actually “busy” and “this old thing” has actually just had the tag removed? Surely when you don’t respond to texts immediately but he’s seen you loitering on Whatsapp (because let’s be honest it says the exact time you were last on) he figures out that you’re not that busy? This “Game” is peculiar and I’m opting out. What happened to the old days where guys would have a massive barny and the best one would win the betty? I like those days."

"This lets me have some fun 'cause all my flannels are from when I planned on cloth diapering Sunshine with some AIOs (all in ones are like washable disposable diapers with velcro tabs). We ended up using EC (Elimination Communication ) and didn't need any extra diapers so...I've a LOT of flannel. Since I'm gender neutral I picked out all the fabric I found cute. There's Bad to the Bone, Unicorns, little toadstools, Frogs, Knights with Castles, motorcycles, space, a Supergirl...just lots. I take silky ribbons that I keep every year and after 'wrapping' it like you would with paper I wrap it with the ribbon. Sometimes I'll pull it up and have this poof of fabric with a big bow. That looks nice for the solid colors. I'll take some pictures of ours to share with ya'll and hopefully you can use the idea next year. Remember...after Christmas sells!"

"How can so many people be so INSANE? Marmite is disgusting! It's been banned in some countries, but that just drives it underground (I myslef, so my shame, have smuggled in pots for friends abroad who've been converted to the stuff, but because I love them, I do it). Governments are waking up to the evil of Marmite, but I don't think it's a war that can ever be one. If only there was a way of recognising Marmite lovers, then it might be easier. You know, we could get them to wear special badges, or round them up and get them to live in certain areas so we could keep an eye on them and make sure they don't spread their vile Marmite love. Surely we have a duty to protect our children from Marmite?"

"The Center for Indian Law & Policy at Seattle University School of Law and the Bristol Bay Native Association (BBNA) has developed a project that will provide estate planning services to BBNA members. The members reside in 36 villages in a remote area around Bristol Bay, Alaska. We are seeking a full-time Fellow to reside in Dillingham, Alaska, where BBNA is headquartered, for 9 months, from September 2012 through May 2013. The Fellow will travel to villages with BBNA staff to meet with clients and provide estate planning services. The Fellow will be supervised by Center personnel and will have on-site contact with an Alaska Legal Services attorney. This is a unique opportunity for a recent law school graduate to gain hands-on legal experience in a unique location! BBNA members have special estate planning needs, and the Fellow will undergo training on those special needs, as well as estate planning for native Alaskans. While this is not a salaried position, travel and living expenses will be paid."

"Processed foods like deli meats contain a lot of sodium, which can interrupt sleep by raising your blood pressure and dehydrating you, Cornell’s Maas says. Caffeine, meanwhile, stays in your system for up to 12 hours, so the effects of a p.m. latte could linger till midnight. Try skipping the joe tomorrow: Not having caffeine for a single day can improve sleep quality that night, a study in the Journal of Clinical Nursing found."

"The way to solve this problem, implemented in GDDR5, is to add a DBI bit. The right side of the figure shown above illustrates the same state transitions, but with the addition of a DBI bit. When asserted, the DBI bit indicates that the data bus should be inverted. The inversion state can change from transfer to transfer and it is changed to minimize the number of data-bit state changes and thus minimize the I/O switching current and the number of aggressor bits from one transfer to the next. Again, this is how it’s done for GDDR5 memory. The DBI method used for DDR4 SDRAM is not yet public."
"Being a realistic novel, the story is of now, the space is where we live and it proves to be a good past time occupying activity. Its easy on language and has a lucid vocabulary, so that one doesn’t needs to carry a dictionary along. Funny at times, it grasps the attention and turns interesting in several parts. The action seems to be condensed in the first 40 pages – love, dating, live-in, sex, college life, struggle for jobs, after which the story seems to lose the pace and give the readers a space to turn a few pages at times. Being the story of how and why the families fall in love the readers are compelled to stick-in upto the end."

After our talk I drove around the city searching for large bags of water I could bring the kids. After an hour of driving I returned with 80 tiny bags of water. It was all I could find, but it was completely insufficient for the 175 or so children and workers."

"But it is too simplistic to claim that government support is the only reason China has had some B2B success. The strength of the country’s scientific and technical talent is growing, and local companies increasingly bring real capabilities to the table. What’s more, a number of government-supported innovation efforts have not been successful. Some notable examples include attempts to develop an indigenous 3G telecommunications protocol called TDS-CDMA and to replace the global Wi-Fi standard with a China-only Internet security protocol, WAPI."

"In this respect, sinister role of Indian RAW could also be judged from some other events of sectarian violence. In 2008, in Khyber Agency, intermittent fighting between Lashkar-e-Islam and Ansar-ul-Islam had claimed as many as 1500 lives. Lashkar Islami is led by fanatic cleric Mangal Bagh who follows the puritanical Deobandi form of Sunni Islam and has close connections with the extremist Taliban of Afghanistan. Besides other areas of Pakistan, more than 2000 people died in sectarian riots in Kurram Agency, bordering Afghanistan. Its areas have been hit by fierce clashes, pitching Sunni Muslims against the minority Shias. A number of ceasefires was concluded between the warring sects with the help of government officials and the tribal Maliks, but the same proved fruitless owing to the support from Afghanistan where more than hundred training centers covertly established by RAW are supervising anti-Pakistan activities with the tactical help CIA and Mossad."

Its economy benefits from the trucks and the tour buses - an alliance that serves this petroleum absent country well and tourists most."

"The man who has lived in this house for several years is the grandson of the farmer who built it, and it was passed down three generations to the degenerate who has let the thing go to hell. OK, to be fair, his mother wasn’t much better. When she owned the house, she would decorate the lawn for the seasons and then leave everything up all year—Christmas lights, a plywood cutout of Santa riding a rocket, a hay bale with pumpkins in various stages of decay, plastic Easter eggs hanging from the lower branches of the scraggly trees. Trick-or-treating kids would walk an arc around the place to avoid it on Halloween."

"Oh yeah, back to the movie, how does all this EPR rambling tie in to the movie? Well, I really wish I had seen it when Eran Kolirin was still here, because I would've loved to quiz him about it. But I can say that festival programmer Rod Armstrong introduced the movie by saying in previous Q&A's some audience members wanted to ascribe mental health issues (anything from depression to schizophrenia) to the protagonist, and Eran was adamant that he's not crazy in any way. Well, that's easy for me--he's not crazy, he's just a physicist. And his class ends one day when he's right in the middle of discussing EPR. So he goes home with all this at the front of his mind, keenly aware he's collapsing Wave Functions all around him. Well, as a guy, what's the one thing that is most profound to collapse by observing. That's right, his own penis. So he takes a second, whips it out, and looks at it in the mirror. Then he notices another guy watching him. And wacky hijinx ensue."

"Completely opposite the saison, this beer was awesome looking. Deep purple almost black and lovely stillness to it. They didn't say how long this was aged in the barrel but it was aged on black wishniak cherries (hence the name) during that time. Pretty sour nose but not as much vinegar as the Phruit Phunk. Started sour up front followed by a huge, sweet black cherry flavor. If you've ever had a black cherry soda, then you have an idea how this one finished. Just tons of black cherry flavor which grew as I drank more. Really great. This was Jo's favorite of the event I believe."

"The culturing of meditation into our system is normal. Some people call it the higher state of consciousness, I call it the normal state of consciousness since we are endowed with the ability to live in that state. Meditation helps in two ways-it prevents stress from getting into the system and simultaneously helps release already accumulated stress. Regular meditation also leads to happiness and fulfillment; to sensitisation of the sensory organs (thereby intensifying the experiences of seeing, tasting, feeling, etc.); and to greater intuitiveness."

"It also gave Stacey a secret. He knew that Mattias didn't know much about cooking. No spice, or assortment of spices, could possibly remove the taste of Andrill from potatoes. Potatoes are like sponges, they soak up every flavor around them. The trick to removing Andrill from them was not in the cooking, but in the sack they were carried in. Stacey's mother, before she died, taught Stacey how to make a sack, and what to make it out of, that cleaned produce in such a way that it pulled out contaminants, like Andrill in general. The flavor of Andrill was out of those potatoes a few hours after Stacey was on the boat. It still made him happy though, because potatoes, like sponges, really have no flavor all by themselves. So, for Mattias to have said anything, Stacey did have his spices right. His mashed potatoes were good. Come out of Andrill and still deserve praise good."

I feel so blessed to be a part of a school that is truly making a difference in students' lives. Making a difference in concrete ways. Making a difference by having a garage sale to earn money to buy two seniors laptops for college. Making a difference by opening the doors to their houses at 10pm to help a student with scholarship essays. Making a difference by demanding excellence because failure is not an option. Making a difference by helping students not just to dream, but to DO. I have some big shoes to fill."

Started sour up front followed by a huge, sweet black cherry flavor. If you've ever had a black cherry soda, then you have an idea how this one finished. Just tons of black cherry flavor which grew as I drank more. Really great. This was Jo's favorite of the event I believe."

"ONCE UPON A TIME, a little boy with a big sword went into battle against Mister Rogers. Or maybe, if the truth be told, Mister Rogers went into battle against a little boy with a big sword, for Mister Rogers didn’t like the big sword. It was one of those swords that really isn’t a sword at all; it was a big plastic contraption with lights and sound effects, and it was the kind of sword used in defense of the universe by the heroes of the television shows that the little boy liked to watch. The little boy with the big sword did not watch Mister Rogers. In fact, the little boy with the big sword didn’t know who Mister Rogers was, and so when Mister Rogers knelt down in front of him, the little boy with the big sword looked past him and through him, and when Mister Rogers said, “Oh, my; that’s a big sword you have,” the boy didn’t answer, and finally his mother got embarrassed and said, “Oh, honey, c’mon, that’s Mister Rogers,” and felt his head for fever. Of course, she knew who Mister Rogers was, because she had grown up with him, and she knew that he was good for her son, and so now, with her little boy zombie-eyed under his blond bangs, she apologized, saying to Mister Rogers that she knew he was in a rush and that she knew he was here in Penn Station taping his program and that her son usually wasn’t like this, he was probably just tired …. Except that Mister Rogers wasn’t going anywhere. Yes, sure, he was taping, and right there, in Penn Station in New York City, were throngs of other children wiggling in wait for him, but right now his patient gray eyes were fixed on the little boy with the big sword, and so he stayed there, on one knee, until the little boy’s eyes finally focused on Mister Rogers, and he said, “It’s not a sword; it’s a death ray.” A death ray! Oh, honey, Mommy knew you could do it …. And so now, encouraged, Mommy said, “Do you want to give Mister Rogers a hug, honey?” But the boy was shaking his head no, and Mister Rogers was sneaking his face past the big sword and the armor of the little boy’s eyes and whispering something in his ear–something that, while not changing his mind about the hug, made the little boy look at Mister Rogers in a new way, with the eyes of a child at last, and nod his head yes."

Considerably less than the larger house next door which is currently for sale. This is the very same house that I recently wrote about being two council tax bands below our cottage. It has the same number of rooms as our cottage, although it is larger. More space means higher bills. The next door house also has a bigger garden. Our garden is big enough for us. We do not want to have to spend all day cutting the lawn. Whoever buys it will be paying a high price for the extra space. Both agents said that the next door house was over priced."

Their exaggerated profitability stems from the above mentioned odds. Interestingly, insurance companies seem to be virtually single-handedly keeping the South African Broadcasting Corporation afloat through hours-long loops of ‘infomercials’ and at least one advert during every ad break. The insurance industry is just another means through which money is sucked out of the economy in an unproductive way, making less money available for actual consumer goods. So no wonder ‘real ‘ companies probably don’t have budget to advertise on tv."

We are living in troubled times and as much as I hate to admit this, I believe that we as the Church have invited this upon ourselves by placing evil or ungodly men in positions of governmental power and influence who have used their positions of influence to enact laws that now threaten families and especially the safety of our own children. Without getting political, let me say that your voice matters and the fact that we have not supported Born Again governmental leaders or demanded that the ungodly follow Biblical principles in leading our nation has brought us to the kind of problems echoed in this troubling report. Check it out."
"Before His denial, Peter had asserted that even if all others denied Christ, he would not. So Jesus begins by asking that question — “do you love Me more than these?” A humbled Peter drops the comparison and simply asserts, “Yes, Lord, you know that I love you.” So Jesus presses further, “Do you love Me?” That is, “Do you? Do you really love in the way that you say you do?” And Peter asserts that he not only loves Jesus, but that Jesus knows that he does. One final time Jesus asks, “Do you love Me?” The force of this seems to be, “Peter, as you reflect on your inward desires and passions, do you really love Me?” Peter was grieved over this third question, perhaps because it reminded him of his denials and perhaps because it had to be asked three times, but he responds, “Lord, you know all things. You know that I love you.” In this final affirmation he is just as emphatic as he was in his final denial in which he invoked the curses of God (Mt. 26:74). Yes, he loves Christ."

"RDX, the most lethal and unstable material, was to be placed inside 55-gallon drums in webbing and the drums then were to be filled with a gel substance. The explosives were to be shipped East, to Dulles Airport, marked as ”industrial solvent,” on the first available passenger flights, Mulcahy recalls. Once at Dulles, they were consolidated into one shipping container, along with the timers and the industrial tools and workbenches needed to set up the explosives laboratory in Libya. Then they were forwarded to Europe for transshipment by Lufthansa passenger planes to Tripoli without knowledge of the airline. All of the men involved in the meeting in Washington understood the implications of what they were doing, Mulcahy says: ”The nitro could have blown if the plane hit an air pocket.”"

"The plan does not preclude the city from joining forces with the county, which plans to build its own expanded forensics center at the Texas Medical Center. If the city and county were to cooperate through the local government corporation, Icken said, Commissioners Court would appoint two of the five board members and the city would appoint two. Commissioners Court and City Council would jointly appoint the chairman, just as they do for the Port of Houston Authority. Incredibly frustrating. Most pols at least offer lip service to the reality that working together would produce a better outcome, but lip service is all it is. The politicians involved appear unable to remove ego and an historic turf-war mentality from the process, and the predictable result is politicization, duplication, waste and higher costs for taxpayers. There are circumstances where rivalry and turf battles improve outcomes, but this is not one of them."

Compare my saying, “I believe that there is no gold on Mars” with my saying “I do not believe that there is gold on Mars.” If I have no opinion on the matter, then I do not believe that there is gold on Mars, and I do not believe that there is no gold on Mars. There’s a difference between saying, “I do not believe (p)” and “I believe (not-p).” Logically where you place the negation makes a world of difference."

"Normally it isn’t that weird to see Jews and Druzes in a positive relation, but this case differs, since the Druze youths are from Majdal Shams, which is situated in the Golan, next to the Syrian border, and many of the Druzes there holds great sympathy for Syria, at least among the older generation. I have talked with some younger Druzes from the Golan, who told me that their generation felt more connected to Israel, though the older generation wanted to return to Syria. That was some years ago though and I don’t know how it is today, though I don’t think it has changed that much."

I really felt like I wasn't supposed to give up on him, despite how crazy it sounded and everyone telling me to let it go. Yet, doors weren't opening.

Having a terrible secret which you feel sets you apart and that can be told to no-one is a normal condition of adolescence, although in most people's experience it's something less alarming than a predatory pet big enough to eat your own father. It's impossible not to admire Stephen's determination and resourcefulness, and the clues are there right from the beginning to his good heart: from his affection for his little brother, through his care for his foster sister's paralytically drunk boy friend, to the fact that he never considered leaving the young crocodile to die when it would have been so much easier to do so."

But I can say that festival programmer Rod Armstrong introduced the movie by saying in previous Q&A's some audience members wanted to ascribe mental health issues (anything from depression to schizophrenia) to the protagonist, and Eran was adamant that he's not crazy in any way. Well, that's easy for me--he's not crazy, he's just a physicist. And his class ends one day when he's right in the middle of discussing EPR. So he goes home with all this at the front of his mind, keenly aware he's collapsing Wave Functions all around him. Well, as a guy, what's the one thing that is most profound to collapse by observing. That's right, his own penis. So he takes a second, whips it out, and looks at it in the mirror. Then he notices another guy watching him. And wacky hijinx ensue."

"In the New Testament, the word used for “spirit” is pneuma; however, Paul in First Corinthians 15:44 used the words: soma pneuma (“σωμα πνευματικον”) which means “spiritual body”. This is the type of body that we, as believers in Jesus, will also be raised with. A week after Jesus had resurrected, Scripture says he was still around for at least one week before his ascension (John 20:26). The resurrected Jesus walked around, made himself known to many people, and he showed himself in a resurrected spiritual-physical body to over 500 people. He was definitely not in hiding.

"In this respect, sinister role of Indian RAW could also be judged from some other events of sectarian violence. In 2008, in Khyber Agency, intermittent fighting between Lashkar-e-Islam and Ansar-ul-Islam had claimed as many as 1500 lives. Lashkar Islami is led by fanatic cleric Mangal Bagh who follows the puritanical Deobandi form of Sunni Islam and has close connections with the extremist Taliban of Afghanistan. Besides other areas of Pakistan, more than 2000 people died in sectarian riots in Kurram Agency, bordering Afghanistan. Its areas have been hit by fierce clashes, pitching Sunni Muslims against the minority Shias. A number of ceasefires was concluded between the warring sects with the help of government officials and the tribal Maliks, but the same proved fruitless owing to the support from Afghanistan where more than hundred training centers covertly established by RAW are supervising anti-Pakistan activities with the tactical help CIA and Mossad."

"But you will notice that Jesus’ resurrection body carries the scars of his crucifixion. As we all carry scars, I’m sure. Life becomes ever more complex and perplexing, to borrow two words from our Lent book. We end up with scars. These scars don’t evaporate, even in the light of the resurrection. But perhaps they do have their uses. Macabre as is sounds, they helped Thomas, and Jesus offered him exactly what he wanted – to put his hand in his nail marks and in his side. Perhaps, believing in the resurrection, even our scars become part of our sending."

"“In 1995, neurotoxicologist and former Director of toxicology at Forsyth Dental Center in Boston, Dr. Phyllis Mullenix published research showing that fluoride built up in the brains of animals when exposed to moderate levels. Damage to the brain occured and the behavior patterns of the animals was adversely effected. Offspring of pregnant animals receiving relatively low doses of fluoride showed permanent effects to the brain which were seen as hyperactivity (ADD-like symptoms). Young animals and adult animals given fluoride experienced the opposite effect — hypoactivity or sluggishness. The toxic effects of fluoride on the central nervous system was subsequently confirmed by previously-classified government research. Two new epidemiological studies which tend to confirm fluoride’s neurotoxic effects on the brain have shown that children exposed to higher levels of fluoride had lower IQs.”"

Is not gross impropriety evident both on the part of those who mount such a display and on the part of those who attend this two-month-long exhibit in large numbers?

"What unfortunately follows is – with the software application acting as a security blanket of project management commitment – true PM techniques and principles are often never learned (nor the application, mind you). Firms utilize the “accidental project management” approach, throw a few activities into an .mpp file, and focus much of their effort on the maximizing the practice of “project management by powerpoint” As a consultant, the most important thing to remember is this – Project Management is in the eye of the beholder (no matter what PMI or PRINCE2 or any other BOK may say.) If your client manages projects through Ouija boards and crayons, then so do you. We must learn to adapt and apply what we’ve learned as project managers to each client and each situation. As PM’s, we should never force feed. We must suggest, nurture, cajole – introduce slowly the project management concepts we know and love – and are enablers of success!. After all, they hired us to be project managers, right?"

"Anyhoo, long story short, lots and lots of blacks in my last neighborhood. Like, every other house. So I was jogging in one of the tonier areas of my neighborhood and there are two dogs in the front yard of this one house. They went after me like I was made out of ham. All I got was a tiny nip on the ankle. They weren’t large dogs, but they were large enough to put a scare in me. Scared, angry me stood in the middle of the street, kind of paralyzed, screaming for the home owners to get their fucking dogs. A large black man comes out of the house behind me. I snippily ask if these are his dogs. He patiently says “No.” and proceeds to clear the way for me. The dogs are intimidated by his height and decidedly not-defensive posture. They slunk away. I offered an effusive “Thank you, Sir!” and continued jogging home. I was shaken. But felt extraordinarily grateful for the nice, big, calm guy who came to my rescue. More big black guys for my neighborhood, please."

"Robbed of her red skirt (plus, the tan, super-sheer pantyhose that lay chicly beneath its funneled exterior), her matching bred lazer, and a white blouse, Glenda loses some of her appeal as the two men, one wearing a blue t-shirt and one wearing a red t-shirt, begin to paw at her organic structure. It's gets worse when her wig falls off and her fake-looking breasts failed to jiggle after being repeatedly poked and prodded by the unruly men. Luckily, the scene is saved somewhat when a naked Glenda wanders back to the mansion to describe, in graphic detail, her encounter with the two burly men to her piano-playing husband. Asking her point blank as he tickled the ivories: ""Did you suck their cocks?"" To which she quickly responds, ""Why certainly."" ""What kind of cocks were there?"" he sheepishly inquires. Uh, ""they were normal cocks."" I know, Glenda, what's this guy's problem? Anyway, the sex scene itself features the missionary position, some reverse cowgirl action (with an off to side handy), and a brief session of anal spooning."

"I did my workout shortly after getting home. Today was Cardio Axe and Tummy Tuck. So, cardio and ab work. I've done both of these before, but not for several months. I forgot how much fun the dancing in Cardio Axe is! I just love it, and I continue to love Leandro's fun, vibrant personality. The only complaint I have with this workout is I would like it to be a little longer and/or a little more intense. It does make me sweat, but not as much as a lot of my other cardio DVDs. As for Tummy Tuck, I now remember why it's been so long since I've done this one. The routine is very good, and I'm sure it will give me nice abs, but I just don't like it very much. It involves a lot of crunches, which I'm not a big fan of (neck straining galore), and a lot of plank work. Which I actually do like, but not for about five minutes total. My shoulders are just screaming at me by the end, to the point where I can't focus on the actual ab work that's being done. I much prefer the Ab Jam routine from Turbo Jam or a couple other DVDs that I have. But it's all good. I will do that workout when I need to and completely love the rest of the program."

"“Two men are enemies,” the Corsican said. “They decide to kill each other. One is big. The other is small. They fight with fists. The small man cannot get near the big man. The small man is the most nimble. But the big man chases him. Eventually, he should catch him, and kill him. Now give to each man a knife. The small man is still at a disadvantage. The big man has more reach. It’s difficult to penetrate his wide guard. But the small man is the more nimble. His thrusts are the quicker. And knife-fighting is a question of courage. Perhaps the big one feels faint when he thinks he may die. Or when he sees blood. The battle is more even. It is more dirty to fight with fists than with knives. To attack another man with fists is a dirty trick, requiring little courage, but only bestial strength.” This Corsican was biased, being an expert with the knife he carried and ate and shaved with. It was a long curving blade, with a delicately curved, black bone handle, I recall. But I thoroughly agreed, and agree with his sentiments. To hell with adventure novelists who decry every man who draws a knife and lionise honest John who fights with his fists."
"Does it matter then what the nose looks like? In an ideal world we would all like our teams to build cars that look nice at the same time as ‘going like stink’ and maybe McLaren are the team, so far, that have managed this but given a choice between a pretty car or one that is going to go faster, as a F1 fan, I would want the faster car! If this style of nose helps Ferrari, Force India and Caterham to improve their chances within the race then ‘bring on the ugly noses’ is what I say!"

"The last time Mercury was retrograde directly opposite your sign was in September 2009. This is always an indication that you have to face old issues with partners, especially ex-partners. It could mean you are similarly dealing with old issues with close friends as well. Whatever the case, all this stuff is back on your plate again. Oy! The downside of Mercury is feeling frustrated with delays. But the upside of Mercury (and incredibly, there is an upside) is that you can quite easily expedite things or finish things or bring them to a conclusion now. Wouldn't it be nice to get rid of this once and for all? Some of you, however, are not dealing with old issues. You're just running into ex-partners -- and all that that implies. (Yikes!)"
"I had absolutely no shame in cheating in GTAIII. Instantly getting the fuzz off my back after going on a killing spree was such a relief.

Burning them to a crisp with the flame thrower, blowing them up with a rocket launcher? AWESOME. The rocket launcher was especially delightful to use. At times I would find some high ground and start shooting people and nuking cars. When the cops brought out a helicopter, I'd just take aim and it was down in a matter of seconds.

Any car it touched was instantly blown up, which made me laugh like a madman every time police cars would try to stop me. The tank has never been as strong in a GTA game as it has in GTAIII, able to take a sizable amount of punishment before you can't use it anymore. As a result, it isn't as fun to use in later installments. A shame, really."

"Oh yeah, back to the movie, how does all this EPR rambling tie in to the movie? Well, I really wish I had seen it when Eran Kolirin was still here, because I would've loved to quiz him about it. But I can say that festival programmer Rod Armstrong introduced the movie by saying in previous Q&A's some audience members wanted to ascribe mental health issues (anything from depression to schizophrenia) to the protagonist, and Eran was adamant that he's not crazy in any way. Well, that's easy for me--he's not crazy, he's just a physicist. And his class ends one day when he's right in the middle of discussing EPR. So he goes home with all this at the front of his mind, keenly aware he's collapsing Wave Functions all around him. Well, as a guy, what's the one thing that is most profound to collapse by observing. That's right, his own penis. So he takes a second, whips it out, and looks at it in the mirror. Then he notices another guy watching him. And wacky hijinx ensue."

On 27 October, the fifth plenary session of the 17th Chinese Communist Party Central Committee considered and passed a set of Proposals for the National 12th Five-Year Plan for Economic and Social Development. The Proposals emphasize the importance of invention and creativeness, both of which are said to be essential for China's continued economic success. Special mention was given to the role of independent innovation, especially in core and common technologies, to help promote scientific and technological breakthrough. The Chinese, taking a leaf from the USA and some other developed jurisdictions, also plan to make the machinery of enterprise run more smoothly by fostering market and industry–research–university partnerships."

"For instance, we learn that in the sixteenth century Conrad Dasypodius, a Swiss mathematician, could have chosen to restore the old Clock of the Three Kings in Strasbourg Cathedral. Dasypodius, however, preferred to build a new clock of his own rather than maintain an old one. Over two centuries later, Jean-Baptiste Schwilgue was asked to repair the clock built by Dasypodius, but he decided to build a new and better clock which would last for 10,000 years."

"ONCE UPON A TIME, a little boy with a big sword went into battle against Mister Rogers. Or maybe, if the truth be told, Mister Rogers went into battle against a little boy with a big sword, for Mister Rogers didn’t like the big sword. It was one of those swords that really isn’t a sword at all; it was a big plastic contraption with lights and sound effects, and it was the kind of sword used in defense of the universe by the heroes of the television shows that the little boy liked to watch. The little boy with the big sword did not watch Mister Rogers. In fact, the little boy with the big sword didn’t know who Mister Rogers was, and so when Mister Rogers knelt down in front of him, the little boy with the big sword looked past him and through him, and when Mister Rogers said, “Oh, my; that’s a big sword you have,” the boy didn’t answer, and finally his mother got embarrassed and said, “Oh, honey, c’mon, that’s Mister Rogers,” and felt his head for fever. Of course, she knew who Mister Rogers was, because she had grown up with him, and she knew that he was good for her son, and so now, with her little boy zombie-eyed under his blond bangs, she apologized, saying to Mister Rogers that she knew he was in a rush and that she knew he was here in Penn Station taping his program and that her son usually wasn’t like this, he was probably just tired …. Except that Mister Rogers wasn’t going anywhere. Yes, sure, he was taping, and right there, in Penn Station in New York City, were throngs of other children wiggling in wait for him, but right now his patient gray eyes were fixed on the little boy with the big sword, and so he stayed there, on one knee, until the little boy’s eyes finally focused on Mister Rogers, and he said, “It’s not a sword; it’s a death ray.” A death ray! Oh, honey, Mommy knew you could do it …. And so now, encouraged, Mommy said, “Do you want to give Mister Rogers a hug, honey?” But the boy was shaking his head no, and Mister Rogers was sneaking his face past the big sword and the armor of the little boy’s eyes and whispering something in his ear–something that, while not changing his mind about the hug, made the little boy look at Mister Rogers in a new way, with the eyes of a child at last, and nod his head yes."

I don’t think any of them have succeeded as much as they did with self-publishing; it’s probably because a) the process was rushed and somewhat ignored because the books already have found its audience and should therefore go on the market ASAP and b) these authors just weren’t built for commercial publication. Their books weren’t, either, which is probably why they didn’t go that route (for whatever reason) in the first place."
"Over the past 40 years, median house prices have doubled relative to household incomes in the Golden State. Why?

My shyness is this: I don’t like meeting new people, I don’t like talking in front of groups, but I also don’t have Social Anxiety Disorder. I get nervous, but I don’t really avoid those situations, and I can overcome that nervousness. It can be unpleasant talking to new people or in front of groups, but it can also go well."
"Apparently there is no need to discover if allegations are true nowadays. Just the fact that someone has been accused by anonymous sources is enough to convict - at least in the press. So much for innocent until proven guilty. Proof of a settlement is no proof at all, particularly when it comes to sexual harassment allegations. It is routine for large companies to pay off on claims like this as it is far cheaper (even at $45,000) than investigating and defending a suit. Ultimately, a southern man - particularly of a certain age - calling someone 'darling' is as much sexual harassment as Brigadier General Michael Walsh's calling Senator Barbara Boxer 'ma'am' was an attempt to somehow demean her. Ridiculous."

"WWII is entering its last phase: Germany is in ruins, but does not yield. The US army lacks crucial knowledge about the German units operating on the opposite side of the Rhine, and decides to send two German prisoners to gather information. The scheme is risky: the Gestapo retains a terribly efficient network to identify and capture spies and deserters. Moreover, it is not clear that “Tiger”, who does not mind any dirty work as long as the price is right, and war-weary “Happy”, who might be easily betrayed by his feelings, are dependable agents. After Tiger and another American agent are successfully infiltrated, Happy is parachuted in Bavaria. His duty: find out the whereabouts of a powerful German armored unit moving towards the western front."

She gets the business deal she wants on the horses her father had purchased, and she hires US Marshal Rooster Cogburn to pursue Chaney with her in tow. She is determined to hire Cogburn because, according to the sheriff, he of all the marshals is the meanest. “He is a pitiless man, double-tough, and fear don’t enter into his thinking.” Mattie observes Cogburn giving testimony in court, where the defense attorney for outlaw Odus Wharton implies that Cogburn is an outlaw himself for his excessive force and shoot-first-ask-questions-later approach to law enforcement.

"In the New Testament, the word used for “spirit” is pneuma; however, Paul in First Corinthians 15:44 used the words: soma pneuma (“σωμα πνευματικον”) which means “spiritual body”. This is the type of body that we, as believers in Jesus, will also be raised with. A week after Jesus had resurrected, Scripture says he was still around for at least one week before his ascension (John 20:26). The resurrected Jesus walked around, made himself known to many people, and he showed himself in a resurrected spiritual-physical body to over 500 people. He was definitely not in hiding. The bible is clear about the form of Jesus’ resurrected body. The onus is on doubters to disprove that Jesus resurrected in a physical-spiritual body."

I received this from my parents as a birthday gift this past February and I cannot explain my love and delight with this product. It's fast, so good and just makes life easier. Tommy doesn't drink coffee so the single serving K-Cups are great. I thought it would help me to drink less coffee but man was I wrong. So terribly wrong. I'm okay with my coffee consumption though."

"Pila could provide us with the blueprint on how to salvage what’s left of our old towns without needing big money. When conservation is the discussion, individuals and groups always talk about money – but I feel that attitude is as important as funding. The people must be taught of the importance of why there’s a need to conserve. Although the church and plaza had received several donations from known politicians, the houses were largely maintained by descendants."
"Does it matter then what the nose looks like? In an ideal world we would all like our teams to build cars that look nice at the same time as ‘going like stink’ and maybe McLaren are the team, so far, that have managed this but given a choice between a pretty car or one that is going to go faster, as a F1 fan, I would want the faster car! If this style of nose helps Ferrari, Force India and Caterham to improve their chances within the race then ‘bring on the ugly noses’ is what I say!"

"I’m over it now, I think. After four days of this newness, I’m feeling calmer. Of course the first thing I did, after shakily receiving J.’s reassurances that “If anyone can do this, you can,” was hit the grocery store near my office on lunch break so I could stock up on a handful of items to make the first week easier. Almond milk – check. Gluten-free pancake mix, for emergencies – check. Organic popcorn crisps for a school snack – check. And, to be completely honest, a box of Rice Chex cereal. No, ordinarily, I don’t buy boxed cereals for the boys. And I’m not sure how proud I am of the purchase. But I knew L. was familiar with Chex from school and elsewhere, and it made me feel better to pick up something that would seem sort of normal to him while I was feeling food-haywire."

"After breaking free from my somewhat sheltered and slightly ignorant small town country life I started working in a German owned automotive company. This came after I left a management position in a pharmacy chain in my bold attempt to explore new possibilities. It was humbling, because this job I went to was a production job, but they paid for my college. The production job was perfect for me, because there was no stress. I only had to work, which allowed me to save all my brain power for the college classes. The most valuable part of the experience was my introduction to new cultures. Of course Germans had a strong presence there, but many others as well. I made my first black friends there because the small town from which I came was 99.99% white. I made a few new Latin friends from Mexico and South America and a few Asian friends as well."

"No mention of Xmas can go without looking at the beer gift sets. I’m in two minds about these. More often than not it’s an attempt to flog you one or two overpriced bottles of piss, with a glass thrown in that you could easily nick from a boozer. However there are people in this world that don’t like to nick things from boozers, so this is one way to acquire the branded glassware that puts the icing on the Xmas cake of cooking lager appreciation. And if you get one, it is better than socks."

We ended up using EC (Elimination Communication ) and didn't need any extra diapers so...I've a LOT of flannel. Since I'm gender neutral I picked out all the fabric I found cute. There's Bad to the Bone, Unicorns, little toadstools, Frogs, Knights with Castles, motorcycles, space, a Supergirl...just lots. I take silky ribbons that I keep every year and after 'wrapping' it like you would with paper I wrap it with the ribbon. Sometimes I'll pull it up and have this poof of fabric with a big bow. That looks nice for the solid colors. I'll take some pictures of ours to share with ya'll and hopefully you can use the idea next year. Remember...after Christmas sells!"
"In this system, it's acceptable to let a 70 year old, die while giving care to a 25 year old, because their life is worth more to the collective - excuse me - worth more to society. To paraphrase their quote, ""it's not discrimination to deny care to the 70 year old and give it to the 25 year old. Everyone who is now 70 was once 25 and the majority of those who are 25 now will be 70 some day"". In other words, ""we can screw you now because we didn't screw you earlier; and if we're not screwing you now, wait until you're 70 and then you'll really be screwed."" The implications are obvious: if a twenty-something needs a liver or kidney transplant and a suitable donor person below 10 or over 50 (judging by Emanuel's chart) is available, these ethics standards say go ahead and kill the kid or kill the grandma and get the working ""unit"" back to work so ""it"" can make money and pay taxes to the mighty Fed.gov hydra."

The castle was eventually replaced by an old warehouse, which offered space and parking, and didn’t seem to cramp Curious George’s style–just like kids, he’s curious anywhere. For a while, a children’s branch anchored a shopping center.

"Oxford in Faulkner’s day was a quaint stop in the North Mississippi hill country on the Illinois Central Railroad line. Mainly, the Oxford stop was to move cotton and students around. A relatively new town by Eastern standards, Oxford as a white settlement goes back only to 1836, when Lafayette County was one of thirteen counties created by the state legislature. But before that, the area had been home to the Chickasaw and earlier groups for around twelve thousand years. In 1837, three men purchased fifty acres for a town from two Chickasaws, Hoka and E Ah Nah Yea, who no doubt saw the writing on the wall: The site was on the Trail of Tears, along which a year later Native Americans would be forced to leave their home and march westward."

I have talked with some younger Druzes from the Golan, who told me that their generation felt more connected to Israel, though the older generation wanted to return to Syria. That was some years ago though and I don’t know how it is today, though I don’t think it has changed that much."

"What unfortunately follows is – with the software application acting as a security blanket of project management commitment – true PM techniques and principles are often never learned (nor the application, mind you). Firms utilize the “accidental project management” approach, throw a few activities into an .mpp file, and focus much of their effort on the maximizing the practice of “project management by powerpoint” As a consultant, the most important thing to remember is this – Project Management is in the eye of the beholder (no matter what PMI or PRINCE2 or any other BOK may say.) If your client manages projects through Ouija boards and crayons, then so do you. We must learn to adapt and apply what we’ve learned as project managers to each client and each situation. As PM’s, we should never force feed. We must suggest, nurture, cajole – introduce slowly the project management concepts we know and love – and are enablers of success!. After all, they hired us to be project managers, right?"

It was actually great - although old, the equipment seemed quite well maintained, and it was excellent to see some of those old styles of activities - giant see-saws (I went on one and was quite freaked out - now that I comprehend danger to a greater extent it is far more exhilarating!) a double slide, those twirly cups you sit in, and a menagerie of bouncy animals."

"“In 1995, neurotoxicologist and former Director of toxicology at Forsyth Dental Center in Boston, Dr. Phyllis Mullenix published research showing that fluoride built up in the brains of animals when exposed to moderate levels. Damage to the brain occured and the behavior patterns of the animals was adversely effected. Offspring of pregnant animals receiving relatively low doses of fluoride showed permanent effects to the brain which were seen as hyperactivity (ADD-like symptoms). Young animals and adult animals given fluoride experienced the opposite effect — hypoactivity or sluggishness. The toxic effects of fluoride on the central nervous system was subsequently confirmed by previously-classified government research. Two new epidemiological studies which tend to confirm fluoride’s neurotoxic effects on the brain have shown that children exposed to higher levels of fluoride had lower IQs.”"

"I placed the lids of plastic shoe boxes upside down under the wire to hold water with a large surface area to generate more humidity. I put a “bumper” of paper towels around the wire because sometimes little legs can get stuck between the grate and the wall. I covered all of this with foam shelf liner; I usually use paper towels but wanted to give this a try. So far, I like the way it will further protect the chicks from the edges. I have a piece of aquarium tubing running through an vent hole down into a shoe box lid so that I can add more water without opening the incubator. Last hatch, the chicks climbed on the tubing and it fell inside, so now I am using a vent hole plug on the tubing to keep that from happening again. I like to put the eggs in a cut-down carton to keep them air-cell-up and prevent hatched buddies from knocking them around. I cut off the tops and the bottoms so that air can move all around the egg preventing the chick from stifling if they pip in an odd place."

I have talked with some younger Druzes from the Golan, who told me that their generation felt more connected to Israel, though the older generation wanted to return to Syria. That was some years ago though and I don’t know how it is today, though I don’t think it has changed that much."

"ONCE UPON A TIME, a little boy with a big sword went into battle against Mister Rogers. Or maybe, if the truth be told, Mister Rogers went into battle against a little boy with a big sword, for Mister Rogers didn’t like the big sword. It was one of those swords that really isn’t a sword at all; it was a big plastic contraption with lights and sound effects, and it was the kind of sword used in defense of the universe by the heroes of the television shows that the little boy liked to watch. The little boy with the big sword did not watch Mister Rogers. In fact, the little boy with the big sword didn’t know who Mister Rogers was, and so when Mister Rogers knelt down in front of him, the little boy with the big sword looked past him and through him, and when Mister Rogers said, “Oh, my; that’s a big sword you have,” the boy didn’t answer, and finally his mother got embarrassed and said, “Oh, honey, c’mon, that’s Mister Rogers,” and felt his head for fever. Of course, she knew who Mister Rogers was, because she had grown up with him, and she knew that he was good for her son, and so now, with her little boy zombie-eyed under his blond bangs, she apologized, saying to Mister Rogers that she knew he was in a rush and that she knew he was here in Penn Station taping his program and that her son usually wasn’t like this, he was probably just tired …. Except that Mister Rogers wasn’t going anywhere. Yes, sure, he was taping, and right there, in Penn Station in New York City, were throngs of other children wiggling in wait for him, but right now his patient gray eyes were fixed on the little boy with the big sword, and so he stayed there, on one knee, until the little boy’s eyes finally focused on Mister Rogers, and he said, “It’s not a sword; it’s a death ray.” A death ray! Oh, honey, Mommy knew you could do it …. And so now, encouraged, Mommy said, “Do you want to give Mister Rogers a hug, honey?” But the boy was shaking his head no, and Mister Rogers was sneaking his face past the big sword and the armor of the little boy’s eyes and whispering something in his ear–something that, while not changing his mind about the hug, made the little boy look at Mister Rogers in a new way, with the eyes of a child at last, and nod his head yes."

"While I knew that Jules and Jim originated as a novel by Henri-Pierre Roché, it wasn't until I obtained the Criterion edition that I learned that Roché loosely based it on his relationship with Franz Hessel, a German writer who translated Proust into German (as Jim does in the film) and Helen Grund, who became Hessel's wife and herself translated Vladimir Nabokov's Lolita into German. Legend has it that Roché also introduced Gertrude Stein to Pablo Picasso through his original career as an art dealer and art collector. Though the circles that Roché circulated in preceded the time period of Woody Allen's recent Midnight in Paris, he did know many of the literary and artistic figures depicted in Allen's fantasy. The real-life coincidences that brought Truffaut and Roché together border on the extraordinary. Truffaut stumbled upon the novel in a secondhand bookstore and it led to a letter-writing relationship between himself and Roché where the young critic Truffaut promised that if he ever made movies, he would bring Jules and Jim to the screen. Jules and Jim was the first novel that Roché ever wrote — which he did at the age of 74. His second novel, also autobiographical, Two English Girls and the Continent, eventually became the source material of a later Truffaut film, Two English Girls. Two English Girls, sort of the inverse of Jules and Jim with two women pining for the same man, marks its 40th anniversary this year but unfortunately, like too many other great films I'd like to write about this year, no proper DVD copy has been made for rental or at a reasonable price, the same situation that in the past two years has befallen other films such as Steven Soderbergh's Kafka, Barbet Schroeder's Barfly with its great performances by Mickey Rourke and Faye Dunaway and two of John Sayles' very best films — City of Hope and Matewan. Who said only old classics become lost films? With the constant format changes, some never made the leap from pan-and-scanned VHS. A true travesty, but I've digressed from the subject at hand. Roché didn't live long enough to see the movie of his first novel, but the film version brought best-seller status to his book that it never saw in his lifetime. One aspect that didn't occur to me until I re-watched the movie for this tribute: Not only has the film reached its 50th anniversary this year, 2012 also means a full century has passed from where its story begins in 1912."

I was a little bit concerned that she might not achieve this status because she can be a bit difficult. Now, finally her dream has become a reality. Not only did Chloe earn this wonderful honor, but her best friend, who is in another class, won the very same honor.

"It also gave Stacey a secret. He knew that Mattias didn't know much about cooking. No spice, or assortment of spices, could possibly remove the taste of Andrill from potatoes. Potatoes are like sponges, they soak up every flavor around them. The trick to removing Andrill from them was not in the cooking, but in the sack they were carried in. Stacey's mother, before she died, taught Stacey how to make a sack, and what to make it out of, that cleaned produce in such a way that it pulled out contaminants, like Andrill in general. The flavor of Andrill was out of those potatoes a few hours after Stacey was on the boat. It still made him happy though, because potatoes, like sponges, really have no flavor all by themselves. So, for Mattias to have said anything, Stacey did have his spices right. His mashed potatoes were good. Come out of Andrill and still deserve praise good."

"The leg movement, colloquially known as the “frog kick” or “whip kick”, consists of two phases: bringing the feet into position for the thrust phase and the insweep phase. From the initial position with the legs stretched out backward, the feet are moved together towards the posterior, while the knees stay together. The knees should not sink too low, as this increases the drag. Then the feet point outward in preparation for the thrust phase. In the thrust phase, the legs are moved elliptically back to the initial position. During this movement, the knees are kept together. The legs move slower while bringing the legs into position for the thrust phase, and move very fast during the thrust phase. Again, the goal is produce maximum thrust during the in sweep phase, and minimum drag during the recovery phase. In the recovery phase the lower leg and the feet are in the wake of the upper leg, and the feet are pointed to the rear. In the thrust phase all three parts create their own wake, and the flat end of the feet acts like a hydrofoil aligned to give maximum forward thrust. The resulting drag coefficient (or more precisely the frontal area) is thus doubled in the thrust phase."

My friend who does this type of writing to pay the bills since she lost her job said the same thing so she doesn't write for them much so I might follow her lead on that one for now."
"It’s not a time to think, what else could I be eating for more variety or mouth happiness? And eating any off-product food during Phase 1 can be a slippery slope. Like the person I mentioned in an earlier post who assumed that cream and sugar were fine since coffee was allowed, there could be someone who assumed that (high-cal, high-fat) dressing was OK with a plain lettuce salad. Not everyone is calorie knowledgeable, and in Phase 1 we don’t count calories."

"When Kaleem is contacted by Razjosh, one of Terrestra's Elders, his life changes forever.

"""Sobran fell against a warm, firm pillow of muscle. He lay braced by a wing, pure sinew and bone under a cushion of feathers, complicated and accommodating against his side, hip, legs, the pinions split around his ankle. The angel was breathing steadily, and smelled of snow. Sobran's terror was so great that he was calm, a serenity like that a missionary priest had reported having felt when he found himself briefly in the jaws of a lion. There was an interval of warm silence; then Sobran saw that the moon was higher and felt that his pulse and the angel's were walking apace."""
"Of course, most practising vampires drain the life from an unblood once in a while, but most make sure they have a careful balance between kills and the safer consumption of vampire blood. After all, in terms of quality the taste of vampire blood is generally more satisfying, more complex and bolder in its flavour than that of a normal, unconverted human being. And the most delicious blood of all, the Pinot Rouge every blood lover knows is the best on offer, is the blood taken from someone’s veins the moment after conversion."

"With just a tiny bit of prep during the weekend, a plate of delicious scrambled eggs is less than 5 minutes away. Seriously. You can time it. I’ll provide a recipe for you to try out, but really, the perfect weekday eggs are more of a method. When you have a little extra free time in the kitchen, pull out your food processor and puree some scramble-worthy vegetables and olive oil. I used a tomato, shallot, and parsley but I think mushrooms, zucchini, and/or spinach would be other good options. Store the concoction in the fridge and use it as the base for your scrambled eggs when you’re in a hurry. As a bonus, I found that this method yields consistently nice, soft scrambled eggs (as opposed to those dry, overcooked bits you might get when you’re rushing to get out the door and trying to multi-task…oops.) I’m not sure why this is, but I’ll take it."
"If we are talking about just knitting and crochet I am pretty well committed to knitting. I enjoyed my crochet projects from last year and I am eager to try more in the future, but the motion of crochet isn’t quite as comfortable as knitting for me and I don’t find myself as inspired by the current selection of crochet patterns as I am by the knitting patterns."
"What unfortunately follows is – with the software application acting as a security blanket of project management commitment – true PM techniques and principles are often never learned (nor the application, mind you). Firms utilize the “accidental project management” approach, throw a few activities into an .mpp file, and focus much of their effort on the maximizing the practice of “project management by powerpoint” As a consultant, the most important thing to remember is this – Project Management is in the eye of the beholder (no matter what PMI or PRINCE2 or any other BOK may say.) If your client manages projects through Ouija boards and crayons, then so do you. We must learn to adapt and apply what we’ve learned as project managers to each client and each situation. As PM’s, we should never force feed. We must suggest, nurture, cajole – introduce slowly the project management concepts we know and love – and are enablers of success!. After all, they hired us to be project managers, right?"
"Since starting Baclofen I am finding that I am much more able to just ‘be’ and live in the moment. I think that’s why I am much more productive now – at work and in personal time.

"Anyway I was able to find my groundation once I heard ppl chuckle at me mentioning how different Kelowna was compared to my urban jungle childhood. This gave me the courage to focus on my Grandmother’s hands.

I then tried to remember the section of my poem that my Grand dad liked best…I hadn’t looked at the poem since last Thurs nite so it took me a minute to retrieve the words. Little shaky but it eventual settled into a rhythm and flo and were spoken out loud. The truth is as I get older my hands are reminding me more and more of my Nana’s."

"What this means it that the bacteria use a small amount of energy (2 electrons) and two hydrogen ions to create ammonium hydroxide and water. Then they convert the ammonium hydroxide into nitrites, 5 hydrogen ions, and more energy (4 electrons). It’s not very efficient, but it’s enough for these bacteria to live on. Note that there are 5 hydrogen ions produced for every 2 ions used… this increases the acidity of the water."

After our talk I drove around the city searching for large bags of water I could bring the kids. After an hour of driving I returned with 80 tiny bags of water. It was all I could find, but it was completely insufficient for the 175 or so children and workers."

"Needless to say, friends, the dream rattled me. It's played in my head at least twice this month, and each time, I've jolted awake with a feeling of panic.

But each time I woke up, I felt the sting of those feelings..."

"A strange thing happened to me in between the first season of Laid and this second season premiere – I grew fonder of the show. This doesn’t mean my opinion of the first season changed; I still think of it as a drippy, one-note, trying-too-hard dramedy, but I did find myself strangely looking forward to the new season because of two key cast members. Let’s place the blame for this at the feet of The Little Dum Dum Club, a hilarious podcast hosted by Karl Chandler and Tommy Dassalo where each episode they invite a comic into the studio for a chat. Celia Pacquola has been on the show once by herself and once with her boyfriend, and Laid co-star, Toby Truslove and both of them were very funny and delightful and I liked them so much I was half-convinced the second season of Laid might be better. While this episode doesn’t come across as self-satisfied as the show did in its first season, a lot of the things that didn’t work the first time around still don’t work the second time around."

"Oxford in Faulkner’s day was a quaint stop in the North Mississippi hill country on the Illinois Central Railroad line. Mainly, the Oxford stop was to move cotton and students around. A relatively new town by Eastern standards, Oxford as a white settlement goes back only to 1836, when Lafayette County was one of thirteen counties created by the state legislature. But before that, the area had been home to the Chickasaw and earlier groups for around twelve thousand years. In 1837, three men purchased fifty acres for a town from two Chickasaws, Hoka and E Ah Nah Yea, who no doubt saw the writing on the wall: The site was on the Trail of Tears, along which a year later Native Americans would be forced to leave their home and march westward."
"And, the atmosphere brings me to the main point as to why we should see more international cricket at Homebush. If we want cricket to grow, it should be accessible to as many people as possible. Last night, there were kids there, probably for their first international cricket match, who would have been locked out by a SCG sellout. The extra capacity of Homebush let’s more people see the game, and it lets more kids have their first experience of the Australian cricket team – and that matters. We can either play more international games at Homebush or have families missing out on really big nights like last night because the SCG is sold out."

He put on his best pair of jeans, and his finest flannel shirt and his best hat and brushed off his good boots and felt good going into worship. Members of the church stared at him the whole service, and as the pastor greeted the old cowboy at the back door the pastor told the cowboy, he should take some time and talk to God about how he should dress when he comes into the house of God. Well next week the old cowboy decided to go back to that place of worship, and he put on the same clothes he had worn the week before. He did laundry them of course. As he sat in the pew waiting for worship, the pastor came up to him and asked, I thought I asked you to talk to God about how you should dress when you come to worship here. The old cowboy looked at the pastor and answered him, I talked to God and he said he had never been to this church and so he did not know the dress code."

"Here’s my take on the three workouts. Bob’s 20-minute workout stands on its own. It’s fun to do, and is great for lifting your mood. The next workout is a 10-minute segment with Jillian, using a lot of the same moves from her ’30 Day Shred’. It is a great addition to the first one for an added challenge. The third workout is with Ajay Rochester and is also 10 minutes long. I find this one boring and not as challenging as the others. Being that it’s the third workout, I guess I thought it would be really hard, but it’s not. It requires less movement than the other two, and is a lot more repetitive. That said, beginners might like it."

"Springsteen often talks of a conversation he’s having with the fans. He repeatedly says he wants to continue that conversation—through recorded and live music. It’s more than a conversation.

It took 45 minutes to drive from the airport to the hotel when it should have only taken no more than 20. We get there, the place looked old and run down. They didn’t keep the pool clean and it was full of leaves. They closed down one part of the hotel because the balcony had ended and was under construction. Then guest services told us we had to pay a different price than what we agreed as a down payment. I thought the room was going to get better, it didn’t."

"What unfortunately follows is – with the software application acting as a security blanket of project management commitment – true PM techniques and principles are often never learned (nor the application, mind you). Firms utilize the “accidental project management” approach, throw a few activities into an .mpp file, and focus much of their effort on the maximizing the practice of “project management by powerpoint” As a consultant, the most important thing to remember is this – Project Management is in the eye of the beholder (no matter what PMI or PRINCE2 or any other BOK may say.) If your client manages projects through Ouija boards and crayons, then so do you. We must learn to adapt and apply what we’ve learned as project managers to each client and each situation. As PM’s, we should never force feed. We must suggest, nurture, cajole – introduce slowly the project management concepts we know and love – and are enablers of success!. After all, they hired us to be project managers, right?"

His coalition partner and fellow Iranian cat's paw, Muqtada al-Sadr, already is boasting that he also will drive out the American contractor personnel who are, for the moment, expected to provide a measure of security after the military withdraws. In that case, we may well see the mullahs' agents take over a U.S. embassy for the second time since 1979 - this one the newest, largest and most expensive in the world."

Will I be able to find the same range of emotions and the ability to change perceptions on my journey toward self and recovery of my health in this city of eight million people? With fear and anticipation I approached Chicago, hoping that my new-found sense of self would not disappear, absorbed in the hectic pace of noise and humanity."

"“In 1995, neurotoxicologist and former Director of toxicology at Forsyth Dental Center in Boston, Dr. Phyllis Mullenix published research showing that fluoride built up in the brains of animals when exposed to moderate levels. Damage to the brain occured and the behavior patterns of the animals was adversely effected. Offspring of pregnant animals receiving relatively low doses of fluoride showed permanent effects to the brain which were seen as hyperactivity (ADD-like symptoms). Young animals and adult animals given fluoride experienced the opposite effect — hypoactivity or sluggishness. The toxic effects of fluoride on the central nervous system was subsequently confirmed by previously-classified government research. Two new epidemiological studies which tend to confirm fluoride’s neurotoxic effects on the brain have shown that children exposed to higher levels of fluoride had lower IQs.”"

"We stayed in Chennai for a few days and then decided to get a train to Pondicherry. I had wanted to visit Pondicherry ever since reading a wonderful book, Life of Pi, which begins in that city. Pondicherry is still heavily influenced by all things French as it was formerly a French colony. There are lots of very pretty pastel houses in streets with French names and in fact the city is divided into the French quarter and the Indian quarter and lots of people living there speak in French, which was bit disconcerting! It sits beside the Bay of Bengal and has lovely stretches of clean beaches and plenty of interesting shops. It`s known as a holiday get away for Indians and we liked it so much we stopped there for several days. Indian women go paddling in their sari`s and it`s just incredibly rich and colourful to see. The police, many of them women, wear uniforms of pale and dark blue camouflage. One time I bought some candy floss from a guy on the beach and a police officer came up to him rapping his knuckle with her baton, she told him to give me more bags and that he had ripped me off, as if I really minded. The only strange event I witnessed was when a very, very old lady came on to the beach, she was filthy dirty and obviously had some sort of mental health issue. Smiling and laughing to herself, she slowly twirled around on the sand then gradually lifting her swirling skirts she sank to the beach and poo`d. Nobody seemed to mind and that`s India for you."

The downside of Mercury is feeling frustrated with delays. But the upside of Mercury (and incredibly, there is an upside) is that you can quite easily expedite things or finish things or bring them to a conclusion now. Wouldn't it be nice to get rid of this once and for all? Some of you, however, are not dealing with old issues. You're just running into ex-partners -- and all that that implies. (Yikes!)"

"“In 1995, neurotoxicologist and former Director of toxicology at Forsyth Dental Center in Boston, Dr. Phyllis Mullenix published research showing that fluoride built up in the brains of animals when exposed to moderate levels. Damage to the brain occured and the behavior patterns of the animals was adversely effected. Offspring of pregnant animals receiving relatively low doses of fluoride showed permanent effects to the brain which were seen as hyperactivity (ADD-like symptoms). Young animals and adult animals given fluoride experienced the opposite effect — hypoactivity or sluggishness. The toxic effects of fluoride on the central nervous system was subsequently confirmed by previously-classified government research. Two new epidemiological studies which tend to confirm fluoride’s neurotoxic effects on the brain have shown that children exposed to higher levels of fluoride had lower IQs.”"

Without the conveniences of modern man, small changes to a single new season could mean the difference between life and death for an entire people. Today, those small changes went unnoticed, save by a scattering of those whose job it was to log the specifics of each day and bleary-eyed traders pondering the long or short of it. They had been replaced by larger and more important changes such as the palette, collar-cut, skirt length and proper accessories of the season. They were decried by imagination mavens in four-color glossy explosions laid out across town in patterns so diabolical a Nazi minelayer would be jealous, but failed to reach the people as much as an early storm or late thaw in the last millennium. There were a few that had seen both, but they had long since left judgment behind and could not say which was better."

In fact, the little boy with the big sword didn’t know who Mister Rogers was, and so when Mister Rogers knelt down in front of him, the little boy with the big sword looked past him and through him, and when Mister Rogers said, “Oh, my; that’s a big sword you have,” the boy didn’t answer, and finally his mother got embarrassed and said, “Oh, honey, c’mon, that’s Mister Rogers,” and felt his head for fever. Of course, she knew who Mister Rogers was, because she had grown up with him, and she knew that he was good for her son, and so now, with her little boy zombie-eyed under his blond bangs, she apologized, saying to Mister Rogers that she knew he was in a rush and that she knew he was here in Penn Station taping his program and that her son usually wasn’t like this, he was probably just tired …. Except that Mister Rogers wasn’t going anywhere. Yes, sure, he was taping, and right there, in Penn Station in New York City, were throngs of other children wiggling in wait for him, but right now his patient gray eyes were fixed on the little boy with the big sword, and so he stayed there, on one knee, until the little boy’s eyes finally focused on Mister Rogers, and he said, “It’s not a sword; it’s a death ray.” A death ray! Oh, honey, Mommy knew you could do it …. And so now, encouraged, Mommy said, “Do you want to give Mister Rogers a hug, honey?” But the boy was shaking his head no, and Mister Rogers was sneaking his face past the big sword and the armor of the little boy’s eyes and whispering something in his ear–something that, while not changing his mind about the hug, made the little boy look at Mister Rogers in a new way, with the eyes of a child at last, and nod his head yes."

"There was a lot of silence (as you might imagine). Then, I heard from a couple families. I wasn't experienced with this. Both eventually said no. I heard a lot of opinions. I was told to let him die peacefully in DRC. I was told that there wasn't much of a chance for him, that no one would adopt a child with a likely death sentence. It was a dark time. I really felt like I wasn't supposed to give up on him, despite how crazy it sounded and everyone telling me to let it go. Yet, doors weren't opening. And how long could a (now 7 year old) child live in DRC in an orphanage with a heart condition that required 3 cardiac medicines to keep him semi-stable?"
"Anyway, back to my mood, I was doing a lot of talking to God last night...just asking for help...when I realized that I still have about three months of anti-depressants that might help me stay out of the dark hole.

Even with her sassiness, spicey-iness, whatever, I just love her. I love being around her. We have so much fun 99.7% of the time. Her sass tends to be more funny than anything else. It’s so awesome. Sometimes I get this vibe…a vibe that I am going to have a life surrounded by Rockstar’s. Children really are my world. I just adore them. Every single one. It is going to be so awesome…I am looking forward to having a life filled with children."

"The negativity that results from this line of argument can be qualified by way of Noys’ excellent introduction, which describes affirmationism’s emergence from two prior theoretical trends. The first of these trends is a nihilistic, post-1968 tendency to align emancipatory potential with the unleashing of capital flows (linked to the early 1970′s work of Baudrillard, Deleuze and Lyotard); but having been rendered untenable by the realities of 1980′s neo-liberalism, this is said to have given rise to a subsequent interest in linking opposition to transcendence, difference, and otherness. Affirmationism’s concerns with immanent, but also oppositional forms synthesised these two tendencies, and Noys shares its consequent avoidance of associating oppositional negativity with either immanence or transcendence: he contends that a focus on the generation of immanent difference would echo the operation of real abstraction, whilst transcendent externality mirrors the ‘void’ of abstract value itself. His account of negativity as ‘immanent rupture’ (17) is not associated with either pole: it is ‘internal’ (128) to the positivity that it contests, but it exists in a ‘relation of rupture’ (172) with it."

During those two hours, I was prouder to be a teacher at this school than I have I have ever been proud to be a part of anything. I feel so blessed to be a part of a school that is truly making a difference in students' lives. Making a difference in concrete ways. Making a difference by having a garage sale to earn money to buy two seniors laptops for college. Making a difference by opening the doors to their houses at 10pm to help a student with scholarship essays. Making a difference by demanding excellence because failure is not an option. Making a difference by helping students not just to dream, but to DO. I have some big shoes to fill."
"My students did a nice job on their own lapbooks. I would say that the only problem with using large pieces of construction paper instead of a file folder is the glue. Construction paper soaks up glue and things are never quite even. Believe it or not, 4th graders STILL don't know how to use bottled glue!!!!! They glued their fingers together, paper to desks, etc. Some of them put so much glue that it soaked through the paper and stuck the paper to the desk!!! Arrgghh!!

"""Sobran fell against a warm, firm pillow of muscle. He lay braced by a wing, pure sinew and bone under a cushion of feathers, complicated and accommodating against his side, hip, legs, the pinions split around his ankle. The angel was breathing steadily, and smelled of snow. Sobran's terror was so great that he was calm, a serenity like that a missionary priest had reported having felt when he found himself briefly in the jaws of a lion. There was an interval of warm silence; then Sobran saw that the moon was higher and felt that his pulse and the angel's were walking apace."""

"Needless to say, friends, the dream rattled me. It's played in my head at least twice this month, and each time, I've jolted awake with a feeling of panic. I've never blamed myself for my father's death. In fact, no one in my family has ever blamed themselves -- something I've always been so thankful for since playing the blame game is all too common when a loved one commits suicide. But each time I woke up, I felt the sting of those feelings..."

"On Nuclear issue too, how can the US and other “nuclear” nations preach nuclear abstinence to Iran when they themselves are armed to teeth with nuclear warheads, with a combined capacity to destroy the complete world at least 15 times over? (Well, one can die only once, sadly!) What legitimacy does all these nuclear nations have which gives them the moral-or-immoral authority to curb an independent nation’s nuclear ambitions when it is repeatedly proclaiming its peaceful intents? Even if the fact that Iran fought with Iraq for almost a decade but that does not make it a global threat! And by the way, we all know that both these neighboring countries were pitched against each other to neutralize each other and create a conflict zone in the Middle East to suit global arms dealers’ desires. Both Iran and Iraq got used and abused by the West, including the US. The intention was only one: to gain forever access to their huge Oil reserves in order to satiate their ever growing energy demands. Saudi Arabia, the world knew, was never going to be easy to target, anyway, and that is the reason it has never been eyed so far in spite of being the largest Oil producer."
"Something stirred within him. Shouts and chatter rang in his ears, palms sweating and fingers twitching in nervousness. The white walls surrounding him didn’t do much for his paranoia either.

He didn’t bother looking at the time, by the way the professor looked around, he knew the bell was going to ring in any minute. Then, he’d be able to go and fix any problem his family had that day. Sure, they’d yell and scream at him, but he’d get the job done one way or another."

"When I was growing up this was a very common dish in my house. My Mom would make this super-simple fried tofu at least twice a week as a snack, an appetizer, or a side dish in a larger Asian-style meal. When I visit my mother in Atlanta we eat it at every evening meal. We’ve been eating this same tofu dish for years and years because it is utterly delicious and surprisingly addictive. The mild curd develops unexpected flavors (sweet, a little sour, a little nutty) when fried, and the crisp edges give it textural interest and a nice chew. Dipped in something as simple as soy sauce, maybe with a little fiery chili paste in it, the little soy bean curd pillows are delightfully fun to eat as you pop them in your mouth. When I married Regina I discovered that she too loves this dish, which made me realize anew that fried tofu is ubiquitous in Asia. Fried tofu eclipses class and culture and politics — pretty much everyone who eats it loves it. Certainly my whole family loves it, including my tofu-obsessed father and my eight-year old son Bennet."

"This lets me have some fun 'cause all my flannels are from when I planned on cloth diapering Sunshine with some AIOs (all in ones are like washable disposable diapers with velcro tabs). We ended up using EC (Elimination Communication ) and didn't need any extra diapers so...I've a LOT of flannel. Since I'm gender neutral I picked out all the fabric I found cute. There's Bad to the Bone, Unicorns, little toadstools, Frogs, Knights with Castles, motorcycles, space, a Supergirl...just lots. I take silky ribbons that I keep every year and after 'wrapping' it like you would with paper I wrap it with the ribbon. Sometimes I'll pull it up and have this poof of fabric with a big bow. That looks nice for the solid colors. I'll take some pictures of ours to share with ya'll and hopefully you can use the idea next year. Remember...after Christmas sells!"
"For both me and my dh, it felt good to be out with friends. We haven't seen many people in the past 14 almost 15 months. It feels like the tide is slowly changing... we're ready to be out more. And perhaps it's a conscious/unconscious way for us to get ready for our next child - we'll certainly want/need the support of friends to help us as new parents to a living child, and help us raise our girl. I am so hopeful that this will be ""real"" - real in the sense that my baby will make it here alive and remain that way. Weird to write that. How many parents think about their pregnancy/expectant child in such a way? Too many, I know."

The idea of a basic income paid to all citizens was raised in 1990 by Leon Louw of the Free Market Foundation in the book Economic Alternatives edited by McGregor (1990). The present author also carried out some unpublished research on the impact of a basic income on the economy on the basis of a social accounting matrix and published some ideas on the basic incomes in the press (Roukens de Lange, 1991). Jeremy Baskin of the Department of Manpower also raised the issue in the press (1993)."

But perhaps they do have their uses. Macabre as is sounds, they helped Thomas, and Jesus offered him exactly what he wanted – to put his hand in his nail marks and in his side. Perhaps, believing in the resurrection, even our scars become part of our sending."

"""The object of this Essay is to assert one very simple principle, as entitled to govern absolutely the dealings of society with the individual in the way of compulsion and control, whether the means used be physical force in the form of legal penalties, or the moral coercion of public opinion. That principle is, that the sole end for which mankind are warranted, individually or collectively, in interfering with the liberty of action of any of their number, is self-protection. That the only purpose for which power can be rightfully exercised over any member of a civilised community, against his will, is to prevent harm to others. His own good, either physical or moral, is not a sufficient warrant. He cannot rightfully be compelled to do or forbear because it will be better for him to do so, because it will make him happier, because, in the opinions of others, to do so would be wise, or even right. These are good reasons for remonstrating with him, or reasoning with him, or persuading him, or entreating him, but not for compelling him, or visiting him with any evil in case he do otherwise. To justify that, the conduct from which it is desired to deter him must be calculated to produce evil to some one else. The only part of the conduct of any one, for which he is amenable to society, is that which concerns others. In the part which merely concerns himself, his independence is, of right, absolute. Over himself, over his own body and mind, the individual is sovereign."""

"Actually, it was supposed to be released in 1987. Thinking the album evil, Prince shelved it. Yet, a fan should still own it, mostly because of the song “Bob George”, an evil guilty pleasure. Usually known to alter his voice to a higher pitch, Prince lowers it on this song. In this voice he makes fun of himself. “Prince?! Ain’t that bitch! That skinny muthafucka with the high voice?!” Actually, this song is a blueprint for future rap lyrics involving cussin’ out and smackin’ women, reason why it’s a guilty pleasure."

"This was a surmountable operational difficulty presented by the linguistic differences between people who were visually indistinguishable. But when we consider the nature of our Muslim Troubles, we see immediately that operating undercover in this fashion is not going to be possible to any significant extent. Nearly all of the Muslims in the UK are something other than white, and nearly everyone in the British army is white. This means that putting together a Det-style army unit to go and prowl around in Muslim areas will be impossible, as there will be no significant pool of suitable people in the army to recruit from for the purpose. It will surely not be beyond the ken of Muslims to see that mysterious white converts to Islam who start coming into their areas may not be exactly what they seem. This is what we will call the mutual impermeability problem, a problem which will bedevil the efforts of all parties to the conflict one way or another. It will be one of the biggest and most significant differences between the Troubles and our forthcoming Muslim Troubles."

He had a difficult personality that kept getting in his way. He was fired from the 1925 Ziegfeld revue No Foolin’ for mouthing off to the boss. He blew a contract with Fox Pictures by refusing to get a nose job. Similar bad luck plagued him with his shot at a radio program for Orange Julius, which was canceled after one broadcast."

"I’ve only ever written novels, though I wouldn’t mind a tilt at TV one day. They are very different media which is why you need to change things, substantially sometimes, when you transfer stories between them. Novels work on the imagination and, if they succeed, take the reader directly into the story. TV is a passive medium in which the screen is the boss and says ‘Watch now’ until it’s done. And you have actors in TV – wonderful actors in the case of The Killing, which means they can get away with unresolved narrative issues which would never be allowed in a book. TV has a visceral immediacy and the ability to mix the visual, the auditory and the dramatic in a way that can root you to the spot. Books are more subtle it seems to me, and ultimately more memorable. My take on The Killing departs from the TV version in some very significant ways, especially at the end. But it’s been interesting that some devoted Killing followers haven’t spotted that. It’s because TV is very much of the moment, I suspect. You’re a spectator, not a participant as you are in a good book. That said I’d still like to write TV before long – it’s such an adventurous and ambitious medium in the right hands."

"Ethiopia’s position was strengthened at the time by the strong connection to US foreign policy interests. With Egypt moving towards the Soviet sphere of influence, the United States took advantage of Ethiopia’s reaction to the NWA by proposing a study of the development of the upstream Nile waters in Ethiopia. By 1964 the US Bureau of Reclamation had produced the Blue Nile Waters Study, which included proposals for a series of huge dams and irrigation schemes in Ethiopia. These projects never came to fruition, yet helped to stoke Egyptian fears surrounding the actions of upstream riparians."

"""The object of this Essay is to assert one very simple principle, as entitled to govern absolutely the dealings of society with the individual in the way of compulsion and control, whether the means used be physical force in the form of legal penalties, or the moral coercion of public opinion. That principle is, that the sole end for which mankind are warranted, individually or collectively, in interfering with the liberty of action of any of their number, is self-protection. That the only purpose for which power can be rightfully exercised over any member of a civilised community, against his will, is to prevent harm to others. His own good, either physical or moral, is not a sufficient warrant. He cannot rightfully be compelled to do or forbear because it will be better for him to do so, because it will make him happier, because, in the opinions of others, to do so would be wise, or even right. These are good reasons for remonstrating with him, or reasoning with him, or persuading him, or entreating him, but not for compelling him, or visiting him with any evil in case he do otherwise. To justify that, the conduct from which it is desired to deter him must be calculated to produce evil to some one else. The only part of the conduct of any one, for which he is amenable to society, is that which concerns others. In the part which merely concerns himself, his independence is, of right, absolute. Over himself, over his own body and mind, the individual is sovereign."""

"I’ve written extensively about ways to restrain the economic power of the wealthy, which largely point to making our tax system more progressive and harder to evade, eliminating corporate welfare, and regulating financial capital to the point where it’s “safe, stable, and boring.” One rare area where there is widespread popular support for progressive causes is tax fairness – witness the popularity of the “Buffett Rule” in the U.S, the unpopularity of Chancellor Osborne’s decision to lower the top income bracket in the U.K, and Hollande of the French Socialists staking his platform on a top tax rate of 75% on the wealthiest."

"A wise (non-Muslim) friend once told me how her (wealthy and financially astute) father drew her attention to the fact that ‘the highest buildings belonged to insurance companies’, illustrating the highly profitable nature of their business. Their exaggerated profitability stems from the above mentioned odds. Interestingly, insurance companies seem to be virtually single-handedly keeping the South African Broadcasting Corporation afloat through hours-long loops of ‘infomercials’ and at least one advert during every ad break. The insurance industry is just another means through which money is sucked out of the economy in an unproductive way, making less money available for actual consumer goods. So no wonder ‘real ‘ companies probably don’t have budget to advertise on tv."

It's impossible not to admire Stephen's determination and resourcefulness, and the clues are there right from the beginning to his good heart: from his affection for his little brother, through his care for his foster sister's paralytically drunk boy friend, to the fact that he never considered leaving the young crocodile to die when it would have been so much easier to do so."

"If you think about it, canning beer makes a lot of sense compared to bottling, firstly there's much less risk of the cap seal failing and the beer oxidising, and there is no risk of the beer within being spoiled by daylight and becoming 'light struck'. They're easier to carry, easier to store and quicker to cool. I'm led to believe than aluminium is a much better recycling material than glass, so they're green too. They certainly take up a lot less space when empty (and crushed)."

"But you will notice that Jesus’ resurrection body carries the scars of his crucifixion. As we all carry scars, I’m sure. Life becomes ever more complex and perplexing, to borrow two words from our Lent book. We end up with scars. These scars don’t evaporate, even in the light of the resurrection. But perhaps they do have their uses. Macabre as is sounds, they helped Thomas, and Jesus offered him exactly what he wanted – to put his hand in his nail marks and in his side. Perhaps, believing in the resurrection, even our scars become part of our sending."

"With just a tiny bit of prep during the weekend, a plate of delicious scrambled eggs is less than 5 minutes away. Seriously. You can time it. I’ll provide a recipe for you to try out, but really, the perfect weekday eggs are more of a method. When you have a little extra free time in the kitchen, pull out your food processor and puree some scramble-worthy vegetables and olive oil. I used a tomato, shallot, and parsley but I think mushrooms, zucchini, and/or spinach would be other good options. Store the concoction in the fridge and use it as the base for your scrambled eggs when you’re in a hurry. As a bonus, I found that this method yields consistently nice, soft scrambled eggs (as opposed to those dry, overcooked bits you might get when you’re rushing to get out the door and trying to multi-task…oops.) I’m not sure why this is, but I’ll take it."

"Completely opposite the saison, this beer was awesome looking. Deep purple almost black and lovely stillness to it. They didn't say how long this was aged in the barrel but it was aged on black wishniak cherries (hence the name) during that time. Pretty sour nose but not as much vinegar as the Phruit Phunk. Started sour up front followed by a huge, sweet black cherry flavor. If you've ever had a black cherry soda, then you have an idea how this one finished. Just tons of black cherry flavor which grew as I drank more. Really great. This was Jo's favorite of the event I believe."

My shyness is this: I don’t like meeting new people, I don’t like talking in front of groups, but I also don’t have Social Anxiety Disorder. I get nervous, but I don’t really avoid those situations, and I can overcome that nervousness. It can be unpleasant talking to new people or in front of groups, but it can also go well."

"It was one of those simple, perceptive questions that require a series of verbal gymnastics to answer in a way that is satisfactory to both parent and child. The full answer is that an equine ambulance doesn’t have lights or sirens because if a racehorse is so badly injured that it would need to be rushed to a hospital, it is usually put down – i.e. killed - right there at the track. But how do you explain to a four-year old that horses aren’t cared for in the same way as humans? We opted not to and instead decided that this ambulance was for getting a horse off the track and that a second ambulance – one with lights and sirens – would be used to take a horse to the necessary medical facility. Pip seemed satisfied with that."

"Before His denial, Peter had asserted that even if all others denied Christ, he would not. So Jesus begins by asking that question — “do you love Me more than these?” A humbled Peter drops the comparison and simply asserts, “Yes, Lord, you know that I love you.” So Jesus presses further, “Do you love Me?” That is, “Do you? Do you really love in the way that you say you do?” And Peter asserts that he not only loves Jesus, but that Jesus knows that he does. One final time Jesus asks, “Do you love Me?” The force of this seems to be, “Peter, as you reflect on your inward desires and passions, do you really love Me?” Peter was grieved over this third question, perhaps because it reminded him of his denials and perhaps because it had to be asked three times, but he responds, “Lord, you know all things. You know that I love you.” In this final affirmation he is just as emphatic as he was in his final denial in which he invoked the curses of God (Mt. 26:74). Yes, he loves Christ."

"A strange thing happened to me in between the first season of Laid and this second season premiere – I grew fonder of the show. This doesn’t mean my opinion of the first season changed; I still think of it as a drippy, one-note, trying-too-hard dramedy, but I did find myself strangely looking forward to the new season because of two key cast members. Let’s place the blame for this at the feet of The Little Dum Dum Club, a hilarious podcast hosted by Karl Chandler and Tommy Dassalo where each episode they invite a comic into the studio for a chat. Celia Pacquola has been on the show once by herself and once with her boyfriend, and Laid co-star, Toby Truslove and both of them were very funny and delightful and I liked them so much I was half-convinced the second season of Laid might be better. While this episode doesn’t come across as self-satisfied as the show did in its first season, a lot of the things that didn’t work the first time around still don’t work the second time around."

"In this respect, sinister role of Indian RAW could also be judged from some other events of sectarian violence. In 2008, in Khyber Agency, intermittent fighting between Lashkar-e-Islam and Ansar-ul-Islam had claimed as many as 1500 lives. Lashkar Islami is led by fanatic cleric Mangal Bagh who follows the puritanical Deobandi form of Sunni Islam and has close connections with the extremist Taliban of Afghanistan. Besides other areas of Pakistan, more than 2000 people died in sectarian riots in Kurram Agency, bordering Afghanistan. Its areas have been hit by fierce clashes, pitching Sunni Muslims against the minority Shias. A number of ceasefires was concluded between the warring sects with the help of government officials and the tribal Maliks, but the same proved fruitless owing to the support from Afghanistan where more than hundred training centers covertly established by RAW are supervising anti-Pakistan activities with the tactical help CIA and Mossad."

"The honest answer is; apart from the web, we’re not entirely sure how we’re going to do this yet. This is something traditional publishers do as part of the process for each book and possibly another appealing aspect of traditional publishers. But I’ve also heard they can do very little to push a book, so it’s a tough one to call."

"Also recognizing that my job situation is not going to change any time soon. There’s been a firing in our department because of boundary violations. Nothing that would ruin the hospital if it were to get out, but definitely an inappropriate relationship between a patient and a provider, and there were people with information who did not speak up. Not good. And not a good time to talk about a “missing” title. So I’m left thinking: what does this really mean to me in this moment?"

"By 1930, he was an M.C. at the Palace. In 1932, he formed a sort of loose team with Jack Haley co-hosting at the Palace. This and a couple of early talkies were the summit of his success. He had a difficult personality that kept getting in his way. He was fired from the 1925 Ziegfeld revue No Foolin’ for mouthing off to the boss. He blew a contract with Fox Pictures by refusing to get a nose job. Similar bad luck plagued him with his shot at a radio program for Orange Julius, which was canceled after one broadcast."
"I carefully waddled across the pool deck, looking up and trying to avoid, well, people, in expectation of stares. I glided into the pool. Scratch that. I plunked into the pool. Everything is lighter in the water....this is what I relished a couple of months ago as I swam up and down the length of the pool. How nice to feel almost normal. But today, today I was keenly aware of a much greater displacement of pool water once I heaved myself in. There was a lady walking with water weights in the lane next to me, and I wonder if my wake threw her off just a little."

"The first time I tried one of their beers was at Edinburgh's Scottish Real Ale Festival in June. It was their Rye PA and, for me, it was one of the highlights of the festival. I've since been lucky enough to stumble upon a few of their beers when I've been through in Edinburgh. Lucky old Edinburgh drinkers for having the chance of tasting Tempest on a regular basis. It seemed that if I was wanting any more of their beer I would have to haul myself from west to east and it proved to be the case when I heard that one of the city's best pubs, The Bow Bar was planning a Tempest total tap takeover where ten of their beers would be available with eight on cask and a further two on keg."

"How can so many people be so INSANE? Marmite is disgusting! It's been banned in some countries, but that just drives it underground (I myslef, so my shame, have smuggled in pots for friends abroad who've been converted to the stuff, but because I love them, I do it). Governments are waking up to the evil of Marmite, but I don't think it's a war that can ever be one. If only there was a way of recognising Marmite lovers, then it might be easier. You know, we could get them to wear special badges, or round them up and get them to live in certain areas so we could keep an eye on them and make sure they don't spread their vile Marmite love. Surely we have a duty to protect our children from Marmite?"
"She has been so “attitudey” lately too. I keep feeling a “spicey” vibe. I don’t know if it’s just because I have Ronan on the brain on the time or what. Even with her sassiness, spicey-iness, whatever, I just love her. I love being around her. We have so much fun 99.7% of the time. Her sass tends to be more funny than anything else. It’s so awesome. Sometimes I get this vibe…a vibe that I am going to have a life surrounded by Rockstar’s. Children really are my world. I just adore them. Every single one. It is going to be so awesome…I am looking forward to having a life filled with children."

"In few areas has the indoctrination designed at the destruction of Western Society been more cruelly effective than what it has done to women.

It is estimated that 53% of all people will have one or more affairs during their life time and that younger people are more likely candidates; in fact younger woman are just as likely as younger men to be unfaithful (womansavers.com). It breaks my heart to look at these statistics. The numbers have only been getting higher."
"Even a multitrillion-dollar package of spending cuts and tax increases would not have stopped the red ink. At best, the grand bargain being sought would have shaved about $4 trillion from deficits expected to total at least $8 trillion over the next 10 years. But it could have changed the storyline of the nation’s politics, if not its government. Obama would have been able to run for a second term claiming bipartisan success at fiscal restraint, a boast he hoped would help erase or at least blur the image of him as a tax-and-spend liberal."

"And that was another thing; their new allies had been fairly accepting of the existence of the Naaru. Some paid them no mind, but many thought their existence sparked curiosity as to their existence and provided even more questions to ask about their faith in the Light. A new era had begun for them, prompting pamphlets, booklets, and novels on the subject. Experts on the Light made copies for all the major churches and sanctuaries of the Light, included their ship turned city, Exodar."

"The hectoring, bullying tone used against individual police officers throughout the inquiry, evident in the Macpherson Report, brings to mind the bullying and spiteful tone adopted by Stalin’s judge Andrei Vyshinsky during the show trials of senior Bolsheviks or that adopted by Roland Freisler, Hitler’s pet judge who presided over the trial of German officers involved in the July bomb plot. The Macpherson Report is a grossly disproportionate attack on the British Police. It must be seen as both a symptom and cause of institutional decay and the loss of confidence on the part of people who in normal times one would expect to be some of the first to lead the charge against the PC vandals. As I argued some seven years ago:"

"Adoption specialists point out that adoptees often feel anger in response to being given away by birth parents, feeling like second class citizens, and feeling unworthy of having anything good happen to them. We must also stay mindful of the fact that many adoptees come from backgrounds where there is a family history of poor impulse control, psychiatric disorders, substance abuse, or other factors that can contribute to a poor modulation of emotions. Thus, when the child is angry, he may have little recognition or control over how intense his response is. Also, children who grew up in violent or chaotic environments had aggression and rage modeled for them and they quickly learn that it is an effective way of getting attention and perhaps even getting one’s needs met."

"Here lie the reasons for the book's success. For all his apparent faults, Stephen is a totally convincing and thoroughly engaging character. You can't help empathising with him. Having a terrible secret which you feel sets you apart and that can be told to no-one is a normal condition of adolescence, although in most people's experience it's something less alarming than a predatory pet big enough to eat your own father. It's impossible not to admire Stephen's determination and resourcefulness, and the clues are there right from the beginning to his good heart: from his affection for his little brother, through his care for his foster sister's paralytically drunk boy friend, to the fact that he never considered leaving the young crocodile to die when it would have been so much easier to do so."

"I’m over it now, I think. After four days of this newness, I’m feeling calmer. Of course the first thing I did, after shakily receiving J.’s reassurances that “If anyone can do this, you can,” was hit the grocery store near my office on lunch break so I could stock up on a handful of items to make the first week easier. Almond milk – check. Gluten-free pancake mix, for emergencies – check. Organic popcorn crisps for a school snack – check. And, to be completely honest, a box of Rice Chex cereal. No, ordinarily, I don’t buy boxed cereals for the boys. And I’m not sure how proud I am of the purchase. But I knew L. was familiar with Chex from school and elsewhere, and it made me feel better to pick up something that would seem sort of normal to him while I was feeling food-haywire."

"After the parade came the Fireworks. Yes, we were super close to the castle, but didn’t want to stay THAT close. We made our way back and then realized our mistake. Main Street was PACKED. A Cast Member holding a light up in the air said, “If you want to watch the Fireworks, follow me…” so we kind of “crowd dove” through a ton of people and she led us to an open patch where no one was standing! Pretty crazy! We were also WAY closer so that Cast Member received a gold star in my opinion!!!"
"Chiara is playing model for this little bag. After all it used to be her pair of jeans she own for less as a year, still would fit perfect. She just added it to the collection of jeans with holes on the knees. So well, I already had it on my list to make a bag for a little someone and the fabric for the lining was already picked out a month or two ago and simply waiting. Jeans came along, movie was playing, scissors were close - ratzfatz - the legs were off. The pants. You know what I meant."

I am singing a song that I learned over 20 years ago but never sang it. I have many friends from recovery who been so constantly supportive about me growing as a spirit in human form that I can't wait to show them a little of what one part of my life, or one of my man LIVES was like.

"Now I'm not the greatest fan of Martyn's Phil Collins collaborations from t'early eighties but I've got to say he won me over. He's got a great little jazzy band behind him that helps a lot obviously, but he can still do it even stuck in a wheelchair and weighing over twenty stone. 'Cooltide', Some People Are Crazy', 'Sweet Little Mystery' and 'Johnny Too Bad' stood out for me and the bass playing was exquisite. Mr Martyn can still sing and play a bit an' all."

"So that’s the main thing I remember about that film. And then, of course, it was a disaster when it came out - and almost immediately it also turned into a cult film – and it still is! Frankly, I don’t quite understand why – except that there’s no movie remotely like it. I saw it again a little over 10 years ago at a film festival in Dallas. They wanted me to come down because they couldn’t get anyone else so I went. And the category it was in was called “Films We Love to Hate”. And I thought wait a minute, they didn’t tell me that! And then I was interviewed in front of an audience at a midnight showing. They were asking me about Otto Preminger. And I said he was one of the great film directors and everybody laughed out loud. Then I started to list a number of movies that are remarkable and have some range. And at every one I said, they would laugh. “Wait a minute,” I said, “This is not being fair.” “Yeah, but Skidoo - we hear it’s terrible.” And I said, “Every film director who’s made a lot of movies has made a couple that don’t work – and by the way Skidoo does have a following.” So then I settled down with them to watch the film and I was like, “Oh God, it is terrible. It’s awful.” He was trying for something original and unusual – and he was challenging himself – but he didn’t know how to do it. It just wasn’t his thing."

"I wanted to pass on an email I received from Focus On The Family. We are living in troubled times and as much as I hate to admit this, I believe that we as the Church have invited this upon ourselves by placing evil or ungodly men in positions of governmental power and influence who have used their positions of influence to enact laws that now threaten families and especially the safety of our own children. Without getting political, let me say that your voice matters and the fact that we have not supported Born Again governmental leaders or demanded that the ungodly follow Biblical principles in leading our nation has brought us to the kind of problems echoed in this troubling report.

Burek posted a really sweet video guide to using Force Push yesterday. So that was fresh on my mind. Now, I have a pretty regular rotation that I use. Force Push is in it, but it’s buried pretty deep and typically only gets used on elites because everything else dies before I get to it, except for random occasions when I use it as an interrupt.

"In this respect, sinister role of Indian RAW could also be judged from some other events of sectarian violence. In 2008, in Khyber Agency, intermittent fighting between Lashkar-e-Islam and Ansar-ul-Islam had claimed as many as 1500 lives. Lashkar Islami is led by fanatic cleric Mangal Bagh who follows the puritanical Deobandi form of Sunni Islam and has close connections with the extremist Taliban of Afghanistan. Besides other areas of Pakistan, more than 2000 people died in sectarian riots in Kurram Agency, bordering Afghanistan. Its areas have been hit by fierce clashes, pitching Sunni Muslims against the minority Shias. A number of ceasefires was concluded between the warring sects with the help of government officials and the tribal Maliks, but the same proved fruitless owing to the support from Afghanistan where more than hundred training centers covertly established by RAW are supervising anti-Pakistan activities with the tactical help CIA and Mossad."

"“In 1995, neurotoxicologist and former Director of toxicology at Forsyth Dental Center in Boston, Dr. Phyllis Mullenix published research showing that fluoride built up in the brains of animals when exposed to moderate levels. Damage to the brain occured and the behavior patterns of the animals was adversely effected. Offspring of pregnant animals receiving relatively low doses of fluoride showed permanent effects to the brain which were seen as hyperactivity (ADD-like symptoms). Young animals and adult animals given fluoride experienced the opposite effect — hypoactivity or sluggishness. The toxic effects of fluoride on the central nervous system was subsequently confirmed by previously-classified government research. Two new epidemiological studies which tend to confirm fluoride’s neurotoxic effects on the brain have shown that children exposed to higher levels of fluoride had lower IQs.”"

Without getting political, let me say that your voice matters and the fact that we have not supported Born Again governmental leaders or demanded that the ungodly follow Biblical principles in leading our nation has brought us to the kind of problems echoed in this troubling report.

"The negativity that results from this line of argument can be qualified by way of Noys’ excellent introduction, which describes affirmationism’s emergence from two prior theoretical trends. The first of these trends is a nihilistic, post-1968 tendency to align emancipatory potential with the unleashing of capital flows (linked to the early 1970′s work of Baudrillard, Deleuze and Lyotard); but having been rendered untenable by the realities of 1980′s neo-liberalism, this is said to have given rise to a subsequent interest in linking opposition to transcendence, difference, and otherness. Affirmationism’s concerns with immanent, but also oppositional forms synthesised these two tendencies, and Noys shares its consequent avoidance of associating oppositional negativity with either immanence or transcendence: he contends that a focus on the generation of immanent difference would echo the operation of real abstraction, whilst transcendent externality mirrors the ‘void’ of abstract value itself. His account of negativity as ‘immanent rupture’ (17) is not associated with either pole: it is ‘internal’ (128) to the positivity that it contests, but it exists in a ‘relation of rupture’ (172) with it."

"I’ve only ever written novels, though I wouldn’t mind a tilt at TV one day. They are very different media which is why you need to change things, substantially sometimes, when you transfer stories between them. Novels work on the imagination and, if they succeed, take the reader directly into the story. TV is a passive medium in which the screen is the boss and says ‘Watch now’ until it’s done. And you have actors in TV – wonderful actors in the case of The Killing, which means they can get away with unresolved narrative issues which would never be allowed in a book. TV has a visceral immediacy and the ability to mix the visual, the auditory and the dramatic in a way that can root you to the spot. Books are more subtle it seems to me, and ultimately more memorable. My take on The Killing departs from the TV version in some very significant ways, especially at the end. But it’s been interesting that some devoted Killing followers haven’t spotted that. It’s because TV is very much of the moment, I suspect. You’re a spectator, not a participant as you are in a good book. That said I’d still like to write TV before long – it’s such an adventurous and ambitious medium in the right hands."

"First I printed a full 12 x 12 using the pink circle pattern from Nursery Tails cart. Then using the print only feature I filled the Valentine word collage with red and printed it at 9.5""."
"And as it turns out, they make for one mind-blowingly delicious soup."
"The world now knows—or should know—that China's legions are on the march. On 27 October, the fifth plenary session of the 17th Chinese Communist Party Central Committee considered and passed a set of Proposals for the National 12th Five-Year Plan for Economic and Social Development. The Proposals emphasize the importance of invention and creativeness, both of which are said to be essential for China's continued economic success. Special mention was given to the role of independent innovation, especially in core and common technologies, to help promote scientific and technological breakthrough. The Chinese, taking a leaf from the USA and some other developed jurisdictions, also plan to make the machinery of enterprise run more smoothly by fostering market and industry–research–university partnerships."
"Hi Dawn, I loved your interview. You did not look as bad as you said you did."
"Maki takes a job at a small company that gives tourists hour-long joy rides on a Cessna. It’s not like piloting fighter jets. But the steady hours mean he gets more time to be near his son. On his first day a strange woman in black, Sara, signs up for a ride and holds Maki at gunpoint, ordering him to fly far off his usual course. The mysterious hijacker takes him to a secret military base where Maki is quarantined in a huge concrete reinforced bunker. His demands to know why are met with stoic silence. Finally, once Maki is securely locked into the bunker’s basement under guard and unable to escape, he is told the answer."

"The roads, including the Interstate Highway System, that are paid for by people whose gasoline tax payments constitute one HELL of a lot bigger share of their income than yours, not to mention, in many cases, bonds that drivers and non-drivers alike pay for. (Fun fact: Pedestrians and private 4-wheel vehicles a disproportionately high share of the costs connected with road maintenance; 18-wheelers, many of which routinely travel over weight limits, pay a disproportionately LOW share of the costs.)"
"2. The streets are full of water and they don’t have a car/boat to get to school. I wish that my internet speed allowed for photo uploads, because I have a great picture of Rio (or Avenida) España during a rainstorm."

"Obviously, America is not a post-racist country. The blurry line dividing the other two appellations — racism and racialism — is crossed daily in overt and subtle ways. The line’s vagueness and the sometimes inadvertent crossing of it reflect the very different American experiences of blacks and whites. The recent shooting death in Sanford,Florida, of unarmed, 17-year-old Trayvon Martin by a self-appointed neighborhood watch captain, for instance, was seen by many blacks as another instance of racial profiling. But feelings of outrage and sadness and a demand for justice crossed all racial borders."
"Inside cheeks blush with punch and laughter. A small hand, sticky with chocolate, pulls a red velvet dress. The candle light shatters through crystal prisms and dances in glazed-over eyes."
"By the time she was 14, her parents sought help from a top-notch Psychiatrist. His diagnosis? ODD (oppositional defiant disorder). This meant that Ashley had trouble with authority, nothing more. She was in therapy for this with the same doctor for a year, and only seemed to worsen in that time. Her grades were all failing by the time she entered high school, and she began skipping classes. Eventually, she no longer attended and the private school had her suspended permanently."
"Does it matter then what the nose looks like? In an ideal world we would all like our teams to build cars that look nice at the same time as ‘going like stink’ and maybe McLaren are the team, so far, that have managed this but given a choice between a pretty car or one that is going to go faster, as a F1 fan, I would want the faster car! If this style of nose helps Ferrari, Force India and Caterham to improve their chances within the race then ‘bring on the ugly noses’ is what I say!"
"Thanks for the ""spurr'd"" gloss, Anne. But how big is the dude's penis? Teh Lady Readers need to know!"
"I get it. Really."
"You look down and close your eyes, droopy. Then expand and stand tall. Raise your face to the sky, turn your hands out, and ask. Out loud. Ask for what you want with your whole heart. (I did it a few times, and it worked so profoundly, I was scared to ask any more. Mistake!)"
"Howdy all- Don't forget that there are only 4 more days left to eter the SPRING FLING CHALLENGE!"
"As a runner, I am the same way. When things are going well and I am oh so happy about life, I do not run as fast and I do not push myself. I just jog along in la-la land noticing the flowers and birds chirping. I have trouble pushing myself to run hard and would rather lay in the grass making flower crowns for my head and do some cartwheels while I am at it."
"So, when we arrived at the wedding, I was not feeling so confident, nor very fragrant or sophisticated. My hair was frizzy, my silk jacket wrapped firmly around me. Every now and again I realised that the neckline had slipped beyond the decent level, and had to give it a quick tug to get it back in place."
"Now, opposing Saddam and the Sunnis were the Kurds, and the Shia. After the US invasion, the Sunnis were the most active guerrillas fighting the US presence in country, but recently they were literally paid off using US taxpayer money. US soldiers simply started to give large sums of money to the Sunni leaders in exchange for them not shooting Americans anymore. It worked... somewhat (Americans are of course still targeted, because they are occupying a foreign country etc)."
"Only around 100 of these beautiful hand silk-screen babies exist! How much are they worth? Absolutely nothing monetarily! But to me the Wild Wigout Comix Game Boards are classic works of underground art!"
"The Police brand has a broad selection of items including sunglasses, jewellery, watches, timepieces and fragrances. Most noteworthy of these items are the sunglasses as they marked the birth of the brand."
"I was sad. The one thing that held that small bit of baby (nursing) and I wasn't even getting that. Each time I offered and she refused I felt defeated."
"So, when we arrived at the wedding, I was not feeling so confident, nor very fragrant or sophisticated. My hair was frizzy, my silk jacket wrapped firmly around me.

"Jack Nicholson sums up this premise in the opening lines of the film. ""When I was your age, they would say we could either be cops or criminals. Today what I'm saying is this: when you're facing a loaded gun, what's the difference?"" But this is just the premise upon which Scorcese builds."

"Mattie is a singular character. Though a young girl, she bosses about as if she were a man twice her age. And she gets her way most of the time. She gets the business deal she wants on the horses her father had purchased, and she hires US Marshal Rooster Cogburn to pursue Chaney with her in tow. She is determined to hire Cogburn because, according to the sheriff, he of all the marshals is the meanest. “He is a pitiless man, double-tough, and fear don’t enter into his thinking.” Mattie observes Cogburn giving testimony in court, where the defense attorney for outlaw Odus Wharton implies that Cogburn is an outlaw himself for his excessive force and shoot-first-ask-questions-later approach to law enforcement. For Mattie, this means, Cogburn has “true grit”."
"Anyway... on with the freebie. It is 6 ""what am I"" poems and a recording sheet for students to write their guesses and support them with proof from each poem. I did it as a ""Scoot"" type activity where I put the kids into 6 groups, each group went to a poem, read the poem, wrote their guess/proof, and then ""scooted"" to the next poem on my signal. It was fun and interesting for me to see the difference in the thinking between the three grade levels! My K kiddos didn't quite get the ""proof"" thing, but the 1st and 2nd graders did well on that! Not having taught K before, being with the three littles that are in my intervention group has been fun!"
"Polymer clay ruining your polish? Use the quick dry polishes or the gel coatings in the nail salon."
"My dad and I have always been very close. That's what comes from being the youngest of 5, 4 years younger than my brother, and wait for it... the only girl."
"Released reports suggest the fire began near a temporary generator that was being used due to problems with the building's main power supply. Hey, they're monks not electricians. However, after the BBC Europe botch job we weren't entirely satisfied with the reported cause of the fire... so we conducted our own investigation. What we found was far more sinister than a Honda generator."
"Yes, I know smoking was bad for me, and that I gave up before the hacking cough and health problems kicked in. I gave up before I reached 40, so I remember all the pleasure cigarettes give the young but none of the downsides, which show themselves later on in life. However, for all the wonders of the world He created, it is surely evidence of a somewhat perverse sense of humour on the part of the maker that so much in life which gives you pleasure, is either bad for you, or makes you fat. There are surely few experiences more dismal than an entirely healthy lifestyle, and that seems rather unfair."
"So I wasn't surprised when I got up early that Sunday morning to drive home that there was fog. Fog is a part of living in the valley ... especially when the temperatures warm up during the day and get down into freezing temperatures at night. The fog, known as tule fog, can be so thick that there can be zero visibility. They even close the schools on those thick fog days."
"This is leaving the safety of talking about the weather and delving right into my comfort zone showing you a glimpse into my life like this. The furball and I have a nice morning routine going. Wake up, get in a good full body scratch, then she goes back to sleep while I get ready for the day. At some point she gets up and starts pressuring me to go upstairs with her relentless meowing as she paces the hall."
"my son found me in the hallway where i was going through their school backpacks making sure homework was done and looking for papers that i needed to sign."

"These disturbing PSA ads by Juvenile Protective Association visually illustrate that “Verbal abuse is still abuse.” And unlike physical abuse which leaves visible marks on the outside, you are leaving wounds with your words that may take a young kid a lifetime to heal. These ads were created by EuroRSCG Chicago, USA."
"She had also accused the council of towing away cars at 10.30pm."
"“It’s nice in here,”"
"I was expecting to be sleeping off a big ol' hangover today in the confines of my house, enjoying the last few days of my winter break and the dulcet tones of my darling daughters as they bean each other with Wii remotes. However, sadly, I find myself BACK in Kansas City - wherein I just left not five days ago - as my mother has become seriously ill. Thus, I flew back today, and here I am, in the land of single-degree temperatures (9, at present,) watching my mom sleep in her hospital bed."
"I pretty much like any and all dressing/stuffing. Down to the Walmart brand boxed stuff you just add water to and let sit for 5 minutes. Oyster stuffing, though? That little unexpected kick is just fantastic. A faint seafood taste that is totally not overwhelming, and really sets off those great herbs and other deliciousness. Yum."
"In fact, we'll be honest: Not a single person on this editorial board had ever heard of the ""expectation of docility and compliance"" that is supposedly rampant in the minds of white people. It's almost like the Human Rights Tribunal... made it up."
"I was attracted to this top simply because the design on it was so striking. I love the mix of colors. Once on, however, it was clear it wasn't going to work for me. I tried on the X-Small and it was HUGE! It swallowed me up. It doesn't look as bad in the pictures actually, just a bit baggy, but in real life, it was a train wreck. Sized out on this one. I will say although it was cute, it's no way $78 cute. Wait for sale and size down on this one."

"I have joined up with over 130 other teachers to give you a SPECIAL FREE gift on Sunday, May 6th. This will be a blog hop that you won't want to miss out on."
"I’ve written extensively about ways to restrain the economic power of the wealthy, which largely point to making our tax system more progressive and harder to evade, eliminating corporate welfare, and regulating financial capital to the point where it’s “safe, stable, and boring.” One rare area where there is widespread popular support for progressive causes is tax fairness – witness the popularity of the “Buffett Rule” in the U.S, the unpopularity of Chancellor Osborne’s decision to lower the top income bracket in the U.K, and Hollande of the French Socialists staking his platform on a top tax rate of 75% on the wealthiest."
"I have been in Greenwich most of this week and, at 0100 in the early hours of Thursday morning, I went down to find the front passenger window of my car had been smashed in. The double locking system on my Toyota means that, if you do smash through the window, you still can’t open the door from the inside. So the yobbo only rummaged through my glove compartment and only managed to steal… the Toyota manual for my car."
"As for the baking, I am getting by with what I know then I come home and nerd out in a world of endless possibilities that is just at my finger tips, then wake when people are rolling home from last call and try again. I taste and I take in. I ask questions. I CAN'T GET ENOUGH. I love it. I am a baker, a baker in training."

"What a crazy, wild ride this thing called life can be! This may sound corny, but I think it’s so important to make a list-either physical or mental-about the blessings in your life from time to time. Sometimes we’re too busy feeling sorry for ourselves to realize how good we really have it. And I want to add all my blog readers onto my list of blessings! Thank you just for being you!"
"Now you can chose to believe me or not"
"I have always thought in three dimensions (I can’t draw for toffee and have much admiration for those who can), and having worked on and off with polymer clay for years, I decided to turn my full attention to that medium and see what happened. To say that I was rather surprised by the outpouring of wee creatures which happened as a result is something of an understatement. Now I am completely hooked on polymer clay – it is the most versatile material, and there is no limit to what you can achieve with it. It’s like painting with clay."
"Amongst other things, the tests confirmed that the Snatch was ""overmatched"" by the then current array of IEDs ranged against it, and also ""revealed"" that even when soldiers wore body armour the Snatches provided little protection from IEDs."
"How can so many people be so INSANE? Marmite is disgusting! It's been banned in some countries, but that just drives it underground (I myslef, so my shame, have smuggled in pots for friends abroad who've been converted to the stuff, but because I love them, I do it). Governments are waking up to the evil of Marmite, but I don't think it's a war that can ever be one. If only there was a way of recognising Marmite lovers, then it might be easier. You know, we could get them to wear special badges, or round them up and get them to live in certain areas so we could keep an eye on them and make sure they don't spread their vile Marmite love. Surely we have a duty to protect our children from Marmite?"
"are merely where my tears fell"
"They further state:"
"It was one of those simple, perceptive questions that require a series of verbal gymnastics to answer in a way that is satisfactory to both parent and child. The full answer is that an equine ambulance doesn’t have lights or sirens because if a racehorse is so badly injured that it would need to be rushed to a hospital, it is usually put down – i.e. killed - right there at the track. But how do you explain to a four-year old that horses aren’t cared for in the same way as humans? We opted not to and instead decided that this ambulance was for getting a horse off the track and that a second ambulance – one with lights and sirens – would be used to take a horse to the necessary medical facility. Pip seemed satisfied with that."

"I woke up, felt great, and went to the market just outside my door to do my shopping for the next few days. I love going to the market on Friday mornings. Waking up to a bunch of smiling faces, anxious to take your cash in exchange for fresh herbs can never be a bad thing!"

"It was only a very short while after that I started the phone calls and the interviews, and only a week or so after those that Joe and I had plane tickets in our hands for Hawai’i! To live and work for what looked like at least ten years. Never before in my life had I had a prayer answered. Whats more, I don’t think I wound up in Hawai’i just because its GREEN, I think it was because of Aloha, and how I needed that to help heal my soul too. I know there is two parts to every equation and that I must learn what Hawai’i needs from me as well, and I am learning, but for me Aloha is an answer to a much deeper and more profoundly impactful question, “how do we heal the sickness that is ravaging our world?” The same sickness of people using each other that I escaped from in Vegas and is spreading across the world, I honestly believe the answer is Aloha. I already love this place, and I wound up here for a reason, I’m not an invader, but want to help defend it, and spread its medicine."
"But it is too simplistic to claim that government support is the only reason China has had some B2B success. The strength of the country’s scientific and technical talent is growing, and local companies increasingly bring real capabilities to the table. What’s more, a number of government-supported innovation efforts have not been successful. Some notable examples include attempts to develop an indigenous 3G telecommunications protocol called TDS-CDMA and to replace the global Wi-Fi standard with a China-only Internet security protocol, WAPI."

"I had heard that Beads of Courage had found a supplier for their butterfly beads, which is true. However, I have found, through dialogues on Lampwork Etc., that when artisan butterfly beads are available, Beads of Courage does want to use and will use the artusan made beads, too. After learning this, I began to make butterflies again. Here's a sample of what I will be sending in with my next box of beads to Beads of Courage."

"Tangrams are another fun alternative. I found a Powerpoint version of Grandfather Tang's Story my first year teaching (and did not own the book yet). I liked it because it could then be projected and was entertaining for the kids to watch. I do not recall where it came from any longer, but here is a link to the copy I have...as well as tangram picture mats for the kids to try to make."

"You can send guests a complex three-dimensional invitation or put your invite on a DVD. You can even send a singing telegram, but you’d still have to send a paper reminder since no one will remember everything the messenger sang."
"As to the names issue, the North tended to call battles and armies after bodies of water, and the South would pick the nearest town or other man-made feature in selecting names, so Manassas Junction was what they called the battle of Bull Run after, and this trend then continued on with many other battles. Fredericksburg is called the same by both north and south."

"Actually, it was supposed to be released in 1987. Thinking the album evil, Prince shelved it. Yet, a fan should still own it, mostly because of the song “Bob George”, an evil guilty pleasure. Usually known to alter his voice to a higher pitch, Prince lowers it on this song. In this voice he makes fun of himself. “Prince?! Ain’t that bitch! That skinny muthafucka with the high voice?!” Actually, this song is a blueprint for future rap lyrics involving cussin’ out and smackin’ women, reason why it’s a guilty pleasure."
"We have been busy for sure. The Kairos walk for the Smith prison unit was two weeks ago. As always Kairos is a time of powerful moves of the Lord, with many lives touched and miracles happening every day. Last Saturday I went back up there for the follow up day, where we begin to train them on how to support each other in that prison environment, and to integrate them into the existing church at the prison. With that comes revelations of ongoing problems and issues. I had two in my group who expressed their dismay at not being accepted in a prayer group on their cell block. At lunch I sat at a table with another inmate, who has been in prison 21 years. He shared an issue he had regarding someone who went through the Kairos walk but was still actively engaged in homosexual activity. Come to find out it was the same person I had talked with earlier. It’s a sticky situation, where I was being asked for advice from both individuals separately. The answer in both cases is to love and forgive. We can hate the sin, but must love the sinner. In the end we all stand before the living God, who knows all things, even the deepest thoughts of our hearts. It is He who is the judge, not us. And it is God whom we must answer too, not man. In prison there are many uncomfortable situations and seldom easy answers. I can’t talk about lots of it but thought I’d give you just a small glimpse."

"After the parade came the Fireworks. Yes, we were super close to the castle, but didn’t want to stay THAT close. We made our way back and then realized our mistake. Main Street was PACKED. A Cast Member holding a light up in the air said, “If you want to watch the Fireworks, follow me…” so we kind of “crowd dove” through a ton of people and she led us to an open patch where no one was standing! Pretty crazy! We were also WAY closer so that Cast Member received a gold star in my opinion!!!"

"Jamaica gets the easy nod for the 4x1 because they’ve finished the race and set two WR’s in the last three Majors. However, I’ve felt for a decade that the WR is soft – and it’s still soft. And the U.S. showed – without Tyson Gay – that it could run leg for leg with Jamaica in Daegu, until disaster struck! This event will be one of those barber shop/internet message board conversation pieces throughout 2012. As for the 4x4, Jeremy Wariner – injured. Tony McQuay – injured. Intermediate hurdlers – subpar. And LaShwn Merritt still crossed the line first. Hard not to make the U.S. the favorite."

"Denied! Most men in Virginia City wore something Dickens would have worn. Mr. Stetson didn't sell his first hat until 1865, a few years after my books are set. Mark Twain, (my vocabulary source for 1862), describes himself as arriving in Virginia City with a slouch hat, a soft felt hat usually of brown or black. That's the type of hat my character is wearing on the front cover of my book. So in my books my male characters wear plug hats, stovepipe hats or slouch hats. And my women are almost universally in bonnets. The dude on the black and white carte de visite up above is Tom Peasley, a famous Virginia City Sheriff from 1866."

"The honest answer is; apart from the web, we’re not entirely sure how we’re going to do this yet. This is something traditional publishers do as part of the process for each book and possibly another appealing aspect of traditional publishers. But I’ve also heard they can do very little to push a book, so it’s a tough one to call."

It is estimated that 53% of all people will have one or more affairs during their life time and that younger people are more likely candidates; in fact younger woman are just as likely as younger men to be unfaithful (womansavers.com). It breaks my heart to look at these statistics. The numbers have only been getting higher."

"In few areas has the indoctrination designed at the destruction of Western Society been more cruelly effective than what it has done to women. In a few generations a sex which once valued honour, virtue and motherhood, now finds themselves either grasping at the Muslim veil of their own subjugation or, tragically with some merit, viewed as “easy meat” by our nations new colonisers, leaving many of the most vulnerable in huge danger."
"yay! more bootlegs!! I love 'em! Here we have 3 cassettes by the unfortunately short lived Dutch Oven Classic Horror Soundtracks label. I have a pretty good idea who was behind this label, but I'm not gonna spill the beans."
"If Tengku is to be an ordinary ‘wakil rakyat’, Tengku should please let the rulers know that Malaysia is an embarrassment because of the Constitution. As internationally and by UN considerations, even in proper application of Islam, with many of the laws and constitutional articles of Malaysia are outdated (even poorly written) and amount to a display of human rights abuse. If the citizens do not act,the citizens will continue to suffer, so when citizens act it is not out of inclination to disruptiveness but a seeking of justice."

"""Sacrifice is a story that's very close to my heart. For one, it's set in Japan and that's always special. Also, I really let myself go on this one. I took some risks I wouldn't have taken before, and I pretty much hung all my hopes on The Red Penny Papers. The subject matter isn't for everyone, and I needed to submit it to someone who would get it. Even then the story could have sucked, so you can imagine how excited I was when it got accepted. So if you like your horror mixed with love and gender issues, check out ""Sacrifice."" Or hell, if you just like Japan!"

"Over the past decade a host of books have been published on the differences between the generations of workers, with labels like Baby Boomers, Gen X, Gen Y, Millennials and so on. As you read books like The 2020 Workplace, Bridging the Boomer-Xer Gap, Generations at Work and similar titles, the authors use the differences between the generations to talk about their skills and weaknesses as groups, and how to take advantage of the skills and overcome the weaknesses."
"Today was a good day. I woke up with a positive attitude. I was excited to get my day going. I had this list of things I wanted to get done—most of which had to do with creating wealth—before I went to my friend’s for dinner. However, by the time I ate breakfast, did my exercises and iced my knee, the day was gone. I was so tired after exercising that I had to take a nap—something I’ve been doing a lot of lately."
"The fire hydrants long since lost their worth. Stripped of copper fixtures. The train tracks became a challenging landscape for continued skirmishing, the 99% ers trying to continue to eat and stay warm and sleep, letting the single percenters know that the price paid for amassing inexpressible amounts of wealth far beyond satisfying of wants and needs, was a society getting stripped of any decent public amenities, or else plastic would have to again become the scab picket line crosser and offer a fischer price kinda fix for the public’s safety, and because there was no other answer to the movements lately moving, the Occupy movement, the SEIU movement, the Anonymous charge across previously unchallenged firewalls surrounding all the confidential valuable evidence of the true nature of wealth getting wealthy in a country practically on sale to treasury-rich China and other highly intelligent growing shareholders preparing for the USA‘s next bake sale, another private offering, initial, secondary, tertiary…it has got to be done! in the face of economic fragility, real estate discrepancy, silicon valley bubble-forming and pressing on and on, full of hot air at the height of 1999, and liable to repeat itself from here on forward, 2012, just you wait and see, because the stock market is most enjoyed when the single percenters are fucking channeling your 401Ks and 403Bs into inflated, modelled, masked, hotrod web presences who will fly into celestial released confetti drops of cashed in stock options called to earth mere days after IPO‘s hit the tape, despite ongoing efforts to prevent the maelstrom, grassroots bodies en masse to block off the wall street circulation this summer, just to maybe stop some deals from going so smoothly, due to disruptions unanticipated and costly, perhaps."
"Some accounts have McClellan ardently opposed to this new medium on those grounds. I prefer a more rational theory: by 1908, McClellan had his eye on a new job -- president of Princeton University -- and in order to get that, he had to be seen as sticking up for higher morals. (Something Tammany candidates aren't exactly known for.)"
"The InnerGameGoddess is dedicated to helping entrepreneurs achieve the lifestyle they desire while serving in an authentic way and living their life on purpose and with passion."
"I’ve only ever written novels, though I wouldn’t mind a tilt at TV one day. They are very different media which is why you need to change things, substantially sometimes, when you transfer stories between them. Novels work on the imagination and, if they succeed, take the reader directly into the story. TV is a passive medium in which the screen is the boss and says ‘Watch now’ until it’s done. And you have actors in TV – wonderful actors in the case of The Killing, which means they can get away with unresolved narrative issues which would never be allowed in a book. TV has a visceral immediacy and the ability to mix the visual, the auditory and the dramatic in a way that can root you to the spot. Books are more subtle it seems to me, and ultimately more memorable. My take on The Killing departs from the TV version in some very significant ways, especially at the end. But it’s been interesting that some devoted Killing followers haven’t spotted that. It’s because TV is very much of the moment, I suspect. You’re a spectator, not a participant as you are in a good book. That said I’d still like to write TV before long – it’s such an adventurous and ambitious medium in the right hands."
"What has Nelson Mandela done to fight against the ANC’s coerced and forced integration policy of Black Elite Supremacy, wherein black Africans, under the black ANC government (a) no longer have the highest per capita income and education levels for Africans in Africa; (b) have experienced a drop in life expectancy from 64 years to below 50, (c) have experienced a significant increase in infant mortality; and (d) massive increases in unemployment due to among others illegal immigrants and massive corruption and looting of the public purse by the alleged ‘liberation struggle ANC’?"

"Of course, most practising vampires drain the life from an unblood once in a while, but most make sure they have a careful balance between kills and the safer consumption of vampire blood. After all, in terms of quality the taste of vampire blood is generally more satisfying, more complex and bolder in its flavour than that of a normal, unconverted human being. And the most delicious blood of all, the Pinot Rouge every blood lover knows is the best on offer, is the blood taken from someone’s veins the moment after conversion."

"In this system, it's acceptable to let a 70 year old, die while giving care to a 25 year old, because their life is worth more to the collective - excuse me - worth more to society. To paraphrase their quote, ""it's not discrimination to deny care to the 70 year old and give it to the 25 year old. Everyone who is now 70 was once 25 and the majority of those who are 25 now will be 70 some day"". In other words, ""we can screw you now because we didn't screw you earlier; and if we're not screwing you now, wait until you're 70 and then you'll really be screwed."" The implications are obvious: if a twenty-something needs a liver or kidney transplant and a suitable donor person below 10 or over 50 (judging by Emanuel's chart) is available, these ethics standards say go ahead and kill the kid or kill the grandma and get the working ""unit"" back to work so ""it"" can make money and pay taxes to the mighty Fed.gov hydra."

"I don’t understand the groups. I’ve searched on there for a job, once or twice, and had some interest once, only once. These kind of results make me feel like it’s pointless, but yet I have an account because, well, everyone else has one. I think of Linkedin the way I think about those plastic, photo-inserts in my wallet. Sure, I have them, but I don’t ever use them, at least not for their intended purpose. I may jam a receipt in there every now and again, but they certainly don’t contain photos! I mean, my photos are on my phone! Isn’t that the way it goes now?"
"For those following along at home, the baby boys were induced at 3.00pm on the 17th of June, which is coincidentally my Mum's birthday, and arrived at 10.20pm and 10.36pm that same day. Let's just say that a twin delivery is a production with quite a few cast members, certainly a lot more than showed up for Isaac's delivery. I can absolutely guarantee that it will be a one time only show, because as cute as they are, they are hard work! So it has been a bit foggy around here the past six months. I have baked, but my mental capacity and time scarcity have not stretched to anything really ground breakingly new. So in absence of cake photos, here are some baby photos instead."

"But it is too simplistic to claim that government support is the only reason China has had some B2B success. The strength of the country’s scientific and technical talent is growing, and local companies increasingly bring real capabilities to the table. What’s more, a number of government-supported innovation efforts have not been successful. Some notable examples include attempts to develop an indigenous 3G telecommunications protocol called TDS-CDMA and to replace the global Wi-Fi standard with a China-only Internet security protocol, WAPI."
"So now I'm switching gears, into one of focusing on the positive, thinking of all the cool people I'm going to meet (there are only a few people whom I've already met who are going to be there, as far as I know!), on the fact that I'm going to get to go to a talk by John Taylor Gatto, and on how much fun the slides and wavepool in the waterpark are. ;-) If you're going to be there, I'd LOVE to meet you!! So if you recognize me, please do say hi, and if not, well, I just hope we run into each other at a talk or something! :-)"

After the US invasion, the Sunnis were the most active guerrillas fighting the US presence in country, but recently they were literally paid off using US taxpayer money.

It worked... somewhat (Americans are of course still targeted, because they are occupying a foreign country etc)."

"If things were not going strange enough, last night, I got hit with malware on the computer. I was searching for some transmission drawings on the internet and hit a site that started trying to scan my computer for errors, trying to sell me data recovery software and showed all kinds of warnings. I could not close it out. I performed a virus scan and a hard drive scan. The scans made it appear that all my files were there, but I could not find anything! Most of the night, the scans ran but this morning it was no better. After returning from the dentist, I had a thought and ran a ""System Restore"" to a time before the event occurred. Sure enough the computer was restored to the configuration from the previous day. The malware was gone and all my files are back. The only thing missing is my Favorites on my browser. I need to fiqure out if those can be reloaded. I am happy this worked, I thought I was going to have to take the computer somewhere and pay to get it fixed."

"Sorvino does nothing but flirt with Nicole, presented in such detail that the film practically becomes a romantic comedy for a short period. Because that’s really what I wanted in a movie called The Stuff; a fat balding middle aged man hitting on a woman. Truly they picked the right focus for this picture. Oh and there’s a few minor parts in there about The Stuff coming to life and killing people…but that doesn’t matter too much…"
"Oh yeah, back to the movie, how does all this EPR rambling tie in to the movie? Well, I really wish I had seen it when Eran Kolirin was still here, because I would've loved to quiz him about it. But I can say that festival programmer Rod Armstrong introduced the movie by saying in previous Q&A's some audience members wanted to ascribe mental health issues (anything from depression to schizophrenia) to the protagonist, and Eran was adamant that he's not crazy in any way. Well, that's easy for me--he's not crazy, he's just a physicist. And his class ends one day when he's right in the middle of discussing EPR. So he goes home with all this at the front of his mind, keenly aware he's collapsing Wave Functions all around him. Well, as a guy, what's the one thing that is most profound to collapse by observing. That's right, his own penis. So he takes a second, whips it out, and looks at it in the mirror. Then he notices another guy watching him. And wacky hijinx ensue."
"On the Friday night, here in lovely Mijas, there was a poetry book presentation at Casa Museo...yes, I know, don't you just love when people tell you... there was!! Sorry, but I did not know about it either until that very afternoon.... we should all read Mijas Semanal much more than we do!"

"DSC played up that point in some regards. I think. I’m not sure what they're singing about and I don’t think it’s all that important in the grand scheme. The obvious Conan reference from their name speaks volumes to their Metal mythology or lack thereof. Again I think it's just that outsider status that makes them so unusual and somewhat scary like the Manson hippies. Living in the desert and appearing vaguely satanic was a potent mix since they don't appear to be clever enough to be faking it. Which seems to make them even more sinister and unpredictable."

"This same species of man, grown one stage poorer, no longer possessing the strength to interpret, to create fictions, produces nihilists. A nihilist is a man who judges of the world as it is that it ought not to be, and of the world as it ought to be that it does not exist. According to this view, our existence (action, suffering, willing, feeling) has no meaning: the pathos of ""in vain"" is the nihilists' pathos--at the same time, as pathos, an inconsistency on the part of the nihilists."
"By 1930, he was an M.C. at the Palace. In 1932, he formed a sort of loose team with Jack Haley co-hosting at the Palace. This and a couple of early talkies were the summit of his success. He had a difficult personality that kept getting in his way. He was fired from the 1925 Ziegfeld revue No Foolin’ for mouthing off to the boss. He blew a contract with Fox Pictures by refusing to get a nose job. Similar bad luck plagued him with his shot at a radio program for Orange Julius, which was canceled after one broadcast."
"I’m over it now, I think. After four days of this newness, I’m feeling calmer. Of course the first thing I did, after shakily receiving J.’s reassurances that “If anyone can do this, you can,” was hit the grocery store near my office on lunch break so I could stock up on a handful of items to make the first week easier. Almond milk – check. Gluten-free pancake mix, for emergencies – check. Organic popcorn crisps for a school snack – check. And, to be completely honest, a box of Rice Chex cereal. No, ordinarily, I don’t buy boxed cereals for the boys. And I’m not sure how proud I am of the purchase. But I knew L. was familiar with Chex from school and elsewhere, and it made me feel better to pick up something that would seem sort of normal to him while I was feeling food-haywire."

"Our friend's daughter's favourite spot was the playground, which contained many ""old-school"" relics of play equipment which Scather had not seen since her youth (a lady never reveals her age, but let's just say it was before laws were as restrictive as they currently are as to health and safety). It was actually great - although old, the equipment seemed quite well maintained, and it was excellent to see some of those old styles of activities - giant see-saws (I went on one and was quite freaked out - now that I comprehend danger to a greater extent it is far more exhilarating!) a double slide, those twirly cups you sit in, and a menagerie of bouncy animals."

"Therefore, we must ask ourselves when we see miracles and signs: How do we know if a sign is from God? We know by the same yardstick of God’s teaching and by the example of Jesus’ own works. We know that God doesn’t deal in parlor tricks and when he moves there is no doubt. We know that Jesus performed miracles humbly, even going as far as to perform miracles away from crowds and to urge secrecy (Mark 7). God is not a showman, he is interested in restoring lives. Even pharaoh’s magicians could whip up some plagues, and even a motivational speaker can make people fall down. Just because it’s a spirit doesn’t mean it’s the spirit, and just because people hoot and holler doesn’t mean its any more spiritual than a rock concert. Just because somebody is charismatic it doesn’t follow that they are spirit filled. Just because someone is pious it doesn’t follow that they are closer to God’s character. Listen closely, people can be radical and be wrong."

"What this means it that the bacteria use a small amount of energy (2 electrons) and two hydrogen ions to create ammonium hydroxide and water. Then they convert the ammonium hydroxide into nitrites, 5 hydrogen ions, and more energy (4 electrons). It’s not very efficient, but it’s enough for these bacteria to live on. Note that there are 5 hydrogen ions produced for every 2 ions used… this increases the acidity of the water."
"The Master also says in Matthew 9 when he is criticized for eating with the sinners:"
"But you will notice that Jesus’ resurrection body carries the scars of his crucifixion. As we all carry scars, I’m sure. Life becomes ever more complex and perplexing, to borrow two words from our Lent book. We end up with scars. These scars don’t evaporate, even in the light of the resurrection. But perhaps they do have their uses. Macabre as is sounds, they helped Thomas, and Jesus offered him exactly what he wanted – to put his hand in his nail marks and in his side. Perhaps, believing in the resurrection, even our scars become part of our sending."
"I passed it by half-a-dozen times before my curiosity got the better of me and I decided to give it a chance.

"Kris Aquino will become the 17th president of the Republic of the Philippines according to Half-British and half-Indian psychic Robert Das. That prediction was half-bull, half-sh*t."
"It may look back infighting between EDL at the demo... but no! We will be fighting with Nazis and UAFs who are pretending to be EDL. We should make this clear to the media if any infighting does occur. Such in-fights have happened before at EDL demos between EDL stewards and EDL fakes."

"I hope everyone is enjoying a relaxing weekend. Yesterday, I did not leave my bed unless absolutely necessary, and caught up on much needed rest, blog reading, and chick movies. It was great, but now my work week starts again. Today I'm getting All Star Weekend ready to walk the red carpet of the Teen Choice awards. I adore these boys, and can't wait to see them, but I'm really hoping to get back to my bed asap! Now if I was actually going to the award show, and could catch a glimpse of the yummy Robert Pattinson, I would care less about bed! And yes...I'm fourteen. :)"

So many people, too many beers, too loud of music, and too many guys making googly eyes in my direction, Now, I like male attention as much as the next girl, but last night was all about hanging out with my friend and coworker whom I’ve never hung out with outside of work before. Those seem to be the nights guys can’t keep their paws to themselves."

"This picture is a very special souvenir from my University graduation way back in 1996. I really enjoyed my 5 years at University studying as an English major, but i was SO excited to finally graduate and start a new chapter of my life. They often say that no matter the experience, most important are the people you meet and the friends you make along the way... Well, i was truly blessed to have met Line during my 2nd year at University and for the next 4 years, we were almost inseparable. She quickly became one of my dearest friends, my 'Partner in Crime' as we liked to call each other back then. Nowadays, we don't get to see each other or talk that often, but she will always hold a very special place in my heart and will always be at the top of the list, where best friends are concerned!"

"Actually, it was supposed to be released in 1987. Thinking the album evil, Prince shelved it. Yet, a fan should still own it, mostly because of the song “Bob George”, an evil guilty pleasure. Usually known to alter his voice to a higher pitch, Prince lowers it on this song. In this voice he makes fun of himself. “Prince?! Ain’t that bitch! That skinny muthafucka with the high voice?!” Actually, this song is a blueprint for future rap lyrics involving cussin’ out and smackin’ women, reason why it’s a guilty pleasure."

"Let the anxious contract you’ve unwittingly written evolve slowly and uncomfortably into a relationship. Find shared interests and common ground like sushi, and folk music. Build an impenetrable bastion upon that ground. Make it sacred. Retreat into it every time the air gets stale, or the evenings get long. Talk about nothing of significance. Do little thinking. Let the months pass unnoticed. Ask her to move in. Let her decorate. Get into fights about inconsequential things like how the fucking shower curtain needs to be closed so that it doesn’t fucking collect mold. Let a year pass unnoticed. Begin to notice."
"So we're showering, and I was telling him why it was that I needed these guidelines. I didn't just come out and say ""Z, I need you to control parts of my life. I'm a control freak and I feel uneasy during the day....I need your strength and guidance."" I know, I know....I should have. But really? That's just so hard to say to him. I spoke carefully, with no tone or any ""put downs"" towards him...I just told him some things that I would like for our relationship. His response?"

I live in the 20th Arrondissement now, and I've grown to love and appreciate its greenness, its young creator energy, the wonderful food that surrounds me, and being in a real neighborhood. But I have to say that the center of Paris is my spiritual home. Probably the 2nd (or 1st) Arrondissement would still be my favorite spot. Beauty, history, convenience. Ah..."

"What he did not manage to do, at least not for me, is to convey a clearer picture of George Washington as a person. Yes, his character, his habits (apparently, he was very fastidious with his clothes), his looks and his way of dealing with problems are thoroughly described, as are the military campaigns and political events he was part of. But if I had to sum up in one word what I feel is lacking here, that word would have to be ""atmosphere""."

"The man who has lived in this house for several years is the grandson of the farmer who built it, and it was passed down three generations to the degenerate who has let the thing go to hell. OK, to be fair, his mother wasn’t much better. When she owned the house, she would decorate the lawn for the seasons and then leave everything up all year—Christmas lights, a plywood cutout of Santa riding a rocket, a hay bale with pumpkins in various stages of decay, plastic Easter eggs hanging from the lower branches of the scraggly trees. Trick-or-treating kids would walk an arc around the place to avoid it on Halloween."
"I will be the first to admit that I loved reading the VA series from Rose's perspective, but with BLOODLINES being told from Sydney Sage's point of view it was pretty refreshing. Yes she isn't as tough as Rose but as the story progresses we see how she begins to become her own person. At the end of VA Sydney was in trouble with the Alchemists for helping Rose escape so we see how she still treads lightly around them but will do anything to get back in their good graces."

"“Moo-oom,” hisses one 11 year old, “I know they’re serving snacks, it’s not like I can’t see you know. No! I don’t want any! Moo-ooom!” It’s curious that the snacks are wolfed down by the mothers, while most of the kids say no; only 12 or 14 years old and already so horribly conscious of their appearance. And all of them are of course dressed in “regulation uniform” – skinny leg jeans, ballerinas or boots, and long hair."

"“You have one hour,” the examiner said, carelessly dropping the test envelope down in front of Anya. “All the sections must be filled out,” he placed a pencil at the top of the desk, “any hint of cheating and your test will end immediately, and you will be prohibited from testing again until next year.” Anya reached for the pencil, but the sharp glare from the examiner made her shrink back into her chair. “The test will begin when I say it does.” He growled, walking towards his desk."
"This was a surmountable operational difficulty presented by the linguistic differences between people who were visually indistinguishable. But when we consider the nature of our Muslim Troubles, we see immediately that operating undercover in this fashion is not going to be possible to any significant extent. Nearly all of the Muslims in the UK are something other than white, and nearly everyone in the British army is white. This means that putting together a Det-style army unit to go and prowl around in Muslim areas will be impossible, as there will be no significant pool of suitable people in the army to recruit from for the purpose. It will surely not be beyond the ken of Muslims to see that mysterious white converts to Islam who start coming into their areas may not be exactly what they seem. This is what we will call the mutual impermeability problem, a problem which will bedevil the efforts of all parties to the conflict one way or another. It will be one of the biggest and most significant differences between the Troubles and our forthcoming Muslim Troubles."

"Sorvino does nothing but flirt with Nicole, presented in such detail that the film practically becomes a romantic comedy for a short period. Because that’s really what I wanted in a movie called The Stuff; a fat balding middle aged man hitting on a woman. Truly they picked the right focus for this picture. Oh and there’s a few minor parts in there about The Stuff coming to life and killing people…but that doesn’t matter too much…"
"Over the past decade a host of books have been published on the differences between the generations of workers, with labels like Baby Boomers, Gen X, Gen Y, Millennials and so on. As you read books like The 2020 Workplace, Bridging the Boomer-Xer Gap, Generations at Work and similar titles, the authors use the differences between the generations to talk about their skills and weaknesses as groups, and how to take advantage of the skills and overcome the weaknesses."

"The movie shoot, filmed on the Kennish property, looks pretty nifty for something thrown together in a week. Regina seems a little taken aback by the money being spent, with props, make-up, wind, and smoke machines. Daphne is also a little reserved, but it’s clear she’s noticing little things around the house that reflect the childhood she didn’t have, such as Bay and Toby’s handprints in a garden stone. Filming is set to begin, but Toby can’t figure out how to work the borrowed (from Simone/Buckner) video equipment, so Simone is brought in to shoot the movie. Emmett and Simone play off barely knowing each other, but he texts her to leave (since she doesn’t know sign). I wonder when the two exchanged phone numbers and why they programmed each other in their cells since they’re “not supposed to know each other”?"
"The negativity that results from this line of argument can be qualified by way of Noys’ excellent introduction, which describes affirmationism’s emergence from two prior theoretical trends. The first of these trends is a nihilistic, post-1968 tendency to align emancipatory potential with the unleashing of capital flows (linked to the early 1970′s work of Baudrillard, Deleuze and Lyotard); but having been rendered untenable by the realities of 1980′s neo-liberalism, this is said to have given rise to a subsequent interest in linking opposition to transcendence, difference, and otherness. Affirmationism’s concerns with immanent, but also oppositional forms synthesised these two tendencies, and Noys shares its consequent avoidance of associating oppositional negativity with either immanence or transcendence: he contends that a focus on the generation of immanent difference would echo the operation of real abstraction, whilst transcendent externality mirrors the ‘void’ of abstract value itself. His account of negativity as ‘immanent rupture’ (17) is not associated with either pole: it is ‘internal’ (128) to the positivity that it contests, but it exists in a ‘relation of rupture’ (172) with it."

She stated that the UK IP regime is respected around the world, and reminded us that many UK industries rely on patents, copyright, and trade marks to protect their designs and creativity.

"The first EP, The Serpentine Similar (Dexter's Cigar, 1993), with the collaboration of John McEntire, is a deeply experimental record. Apart from a few scant touches by McEntire on percussion, the tracks are arranged for guitar and bass only or for piano and bass (in rare exceptions voice too).

"8) Menu Planning"
"I find it hard to be critical of a surplus budget brought down by a Leftist government. I never thought to see such a thing in my lifetime. And the fact that the surplus was partly achieved by welfare cuts is all the more amazing. And even the defence cuts did not involve any reduction in personnel numbers. And allowing for business losses to be carried backwards as well as forwards is both innovative and potentially very helpful to business. And lifting the tax-free threshold was WAY overdue."
"On the bus we are briefed not to help the children climb trees or to find the solution for them but allow them to sort out their own problems. Christa gives the example of a new member of staff who came out for the first time and saw a child trying to fish a plastic bag out of the stream with a short stick. The adult gave the child a longer stick and said 'here try this'. Christa says this experience meant that the child did not get to make the learning that was possible in this situation. There was so much more learning that could have happened without the adults intervention."

"Since the 1980s the Greens have been telling everyone that carbon dioxide was causing global warming—now called climate change—and warning that CO2 emissions were going to kill everyone in the world if they weren’t dramatically reduced. The ball was put in motion with the United Nations 1997 Kyoto Protocols when many nations agreed to this absurd idea and carried forward by the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ever since."

"A few years back I was lucky enough to hear Bunny Williams give a talk to trade professionals at High Point Furniture Market. I went in with an open mind but realistically expected to hear an ""out of touch New York"" decorators take on the industry. One of those designers who makes you rid yourself of everything and start from scratch. One of those people who thinks that $500/yard fabric is a ""must use."" Those folks are out there (and published in lots of magazines) but she certainly wasn't one of them! I was pleasantly surprised to hear her take on the industry, her ""lived & learned"" experiences, and design philosophy. We were far more alike than I knew and she quickly became one of my very favorite industry professionals."
"Next: Learn to anticipate things. A parent is an expert at seeing possible dangers their children can walk into, mostly from experience.

Smile, laugh and enjoy the moment!"
"“Summer Love” – Eskimos"
"As it was, I followed a careful diet for the first 8 weeks of the program. I ate lean meats, nothing fried, lots of vegetables, extra protein. I stayed very close to the ingredients they listed in the plan. In two months, I had zero burgers, one order of fries, and two slices of pizza. I even limited my beer intake to about 2 a week. For me, this dietary discipline is as impressive as sticking to a workout plan 6 days a week for 3 months."
"The last time Mercury was retrograde directly opposite your sign was in September 2009. This is always an indication that you have to face old issues with partners, especially ex-partners. It could mean you are similarly dealing with old issues with close friends as well. Whatever the case, all this stuff is back on your plate again. Oy! The downside of Mercury is feeling frustrated with delays. But the upside of Mercury (and incredibly, there is an upside) is that you can quite easily expedite things or finish things or bring them to a conclusion now. Wouldn't it be nice to get rid of this once and for all? Some of you, however, are not dealing with old issues. You're just running into ex-partners -- and all that that implies. (Yikes!)"

"So, today I'm linking up with Heather again for her Book Club Friday and talking about Jane Green's newest novel, Another Piece of My Heart."
"As I watch my son sleeping now, nine years later, I am amazed at this child who came so dramatically into the world. My 7lb 3oz baby who litterally got stuck, has not been stuck ever again. A child who gave his older brother the courage to face fears. A little boy who had excema on his face and a ready smile to all he met. A baby who did not toddle, but ran. A child who still bursts forth head first into things in life. A sensitive guy who many people misinterpret. A little boy who is more like me than I sometimes want to acknowledge. I sit here, nine years later, and thank God for the lessons Cullen has taught me. From learning to love another child, to watching brothers grow with one arm slung around the other's shoulders. From early morning feedings where it is just baby and Mommy, to double stroller walks with Daddy. Somewhere along the way he potty trained in one day, learned to read, tie his shoes, and will be entering the 4th grade. His peaceful sleeping face reflects not only the child he was, but the man he will become, with God's grace."

"He joins a band of bounty hunters whose activities degenerate to massacre, robbery and rape (the leader Glanton, is based on an actual historical figure and many events in the book have their roots in history). They kill for money and for fun. And sometimes they kill for no obvious reason at all. It’s pretty grim."
"Imagine that you are one of the top people in your field. Imagine that you have worked hard for 15 years to not only master a demanding art form, but contributed significantly to the development of that art form. In so doing, you've proudly made a good living, supported yourself and your wife, risen out of your humble circumstances, and even managed to buy a large house in a nice neighborhood."

"Significant signings? Let’s start with the JUCOs. The top-rated junior-college player in the country is now a Tennessee Volunteer. Wide receiver Cordarrelle Patterson is a player of a position that is potentially an embarrassment of riches for the Vols. Patterson is one of four 4-star WRs coming in. Another is the best WR recruit out of Georgia — Jason Croom. Alton “Pig” Howard is another tasty WR signee for at least his name alone. Is Wide Receiver U back? The two other JUCOs are defensive linemen, a position that needs some experience right away. All three of the JUCOs can step in and be expected to contribute immediately."

"""The object of this Essay is to assert one very simple principle, as entitled to govern absolutely the dealings of society with the individual in the way of compulsion and control, whether the means used be physical force in the form of legal penalties, or the moral coercion of public opinion. That principle is, that the sole end for which mankind are warranted, individually or collectively, in interfering with the liberty of action of any of their number, is self-protection. That the only purpose for which power can be rightfully exercised over any member of a civilised community, against his will, is to prevent harm to others. His own good, either physical or moral, is not a sufficient warrant. He cannot rightfully be compelled to do or forbear because it will be better for him to do so, because it will make him happier, because, in the opinions of others, to do so would be wise, or even right. These are good reasons for remonstrating with him, or reasoning with him, or persuading him, or entreating him, but not for compelling him, or visiting him with any evil in case he do otherwise. To justify that, the conduct from which it is desired to deter him must be calculated to produce evil to some one else. The only part of the conduct of any one, for which he is amenable to society, is that which concerns others. In the part which merely concerns himself, his independence is, of right, absolute. Over himself, over his own body and mind, the individual is sovereign."""

"Duncan Hines' website has pretty good instructions on how to put them together. You can find them here. The best tip, I felt, was microwaving the Oreos a few seconds to soften them so they would separate easier.

I used a small off-set spatula to carefully scrape the cream off one side of the cookie and put it on the other side that had the majority of the cream filling. Then, using that spatula (having the small off-set spatula ~ you know, the kind for smoothing frosting on cakes, cupcakes ~ really made this job easy) I smoothed the cream as best as possible."

Once at Dulles, they were consolidated into one shipping container, along with the timers and the industrial tools and workbenches needed to set up the explosives laboratory in Libya. Then they were forwarded to Europe for transshipment by Lufthansa passenger planes to Tripoli without knowledge of the airline. All of the men involved in the meeting in Washington understood the implications of what they were doing, Mulcahy says: ”The nitro could have blown if the plane hit an air pocket.”"

"So what is the LEED-PAC? Is it what it seems? Why have its listed proponents and financial backers ‘flocked together’? Do they have a stereotypical commonality, other than pure altruism? Could the LEED-PAC actually be a grouping of individuals who have vested financial or other interests in the outcomes of the coming elections, both in May and in November? One typecast observation is that the LEED-PAC is about maintaining a certain degree of control on economic development in LeeCounty; are they the so-called ‘establishment good ole boys’? Many of the LEED-PAC people have heavy financial interest in how development will transpire in the County. That doesn’t sound altruistic, rather it sounds eerily like keeping control on how money is made and who gets to make it. It also sound eerily like it entails how public tax dollars are spent, and who gets to benefit from that spending. Is the LEED-PAC a ‘Trayvon hoodie’ hiding something unknown, with unknown intent? Maybe it’s time to know just how innocent or sinister this group is. Perhaps someone will publish a column exposing just who these shadowy LEED-PAC people are and identify the businesses they run. Inquiring minds want to know."

"So I wasn't surprised when I got up early that Sunday morning to drive home that there was fog. Fog is a part of living in the valley ... especially when the temperatures warm up during the day and get down into freezing temperatures at night. The fog, known as tule fog, can be so thick that there can be zero visibility. They even close the schools on those thick fog days."

My step-grandpa died on the surgery table and my grandma (different side) had a stroke while in surgery which didn't kill her but lead to her death. Surgeries just don't give me any positive feelings and scare me like crazy. Therefore, the days leading up to the surgery and surgery day, I was stressed and could cry at the drop of a hat. With much relief I can say that all went fine and while she feels like she got ran over by a semi, she is OK."

"RDX, the most lethal and unstable material, was to be placed inside 55-gallon drums in webbing and the drums then were to be filled with a gel substance. The explosives were to be shipped East, to Dulles Airport, marked as ”industrial solvent,” on the first available passenger flights, Mulcahy recalls. Once at Dulles, they were consolidated into one shipping container, along with the timers and the industrial tools and workbenches needed to set up the explosives laboratory in Libya. Then they were forwarded to Europe for transshipment by Lufthansa passenger planes to Tripoli without knowledge of the airline. All of the men involved in the meeting in Washington understood the implications of what they were doing, Mulcahy says: ”The nitro could have blown if the plane hit an air pocket.”"

If you don’t respect a centralized ethical system, then you end up making your own gods, being dissatisfied with the inheritance given you by God, you rape and murder and then go to war with your brothers.

"Therefore, we must ask ourselves when we see miracles and signs: How do we know if a sign is from God? We know by the same yardstick of God’s teaching and by the example of Jesus’ own works. We know that God doesn’t deal in parlor tricks and when he moves there is no doubt. We know that Jesus performed miracles humbly, even going as far as to perform miracles away from crowds and to urge secrecy (Mark 7). God is not a showman, he is interested in restoring lives. Even pharaoh’s magicians could whip up some plagues, and even a motivational speaker can make people fall down. Just because it’s a spirit doesn’t mean it’s the spirit, and just because people hoot and holler doesn’t mean its any more spiritual than a rock concert. Just because somebody is charismatic it doesn’t follow that they are spirit filled. Just because someone is pious it doesn’t follow that they are closer to God’s character. Listen closely, people can be radical and be wrong."

"""The object of this Essay is to assert one very simple principle, as entitled to govern absolutely the dealings of society with the individual in the way of compulsion and control, whether the means used be physical force in the form of legal penalties, or the moral coercion of public opinion. That principle is, that the sole end for which mankind are warranted, individually or collectively, in interfering with the liberty of action of any of their number, is self-protection. That the only purpose for which power can be rightfully exercised over any member of a civilised community, against his will, is to prevent harm to others. His own good, either physical or moral, is not a sufficient warrant. He cannot rightfully be compelled to do or forbear because it will be better for him to do so, because it will make him happier, because, in the opinions of others, to do so would be wise, or even right. These are good reasons for remonstrating with him, or reasoning with him, or persuading him, or entreating him, but not for compelling him, or visiting him with any evil in case he do otherwise. To justify that, the conduct from which it is desired to deter him must be calculated to produce evil to some one else. The only part of the conduct of any one, for which he is amenable to society, is that which concerns others. In the part which merely concerns himself, his independence is, of right, absolute. Over himself, over his own body and mind, the individual is sovereign."""

"I’ve written extensively about ways to restrain the economic power of the wealthy, which largely point to making our tax system more progressive and harder to evade, eliminating corporate welfare, and regulating financial capital to the point where it’s “safe, stable, and boring.” One rare area where there is widespread popular support for progressive causes is tax fairness – witness the popularity of the “Buffett Rule” in the U.S, the unpopularity of Chancellor Osborne’s decision to lower the top income bracket in the U.K, and Hollande of the French Socialists staking his platform on a top tax rate of 75% on the wealthiest."
"Anyhoo, long story short, lots and lots of blacks in my last neighborhood. Like, every other house. So I was jogging in one of the tonier areas of my neighborhood and there are two dogs in the front yard of this one house. They went after me like I was made out of ham. All I got was a tiny nip on the ankle. They weren’t large dogs, but they were large enough to put a scare in me. Scared, angry me stood in the middle of the street, kind of paralyzed, screaming for the home owners to get their fucking dogs. A large black man comes out of the house behind me. I snippily ask if these are his dogs. He patiently says “No.” and proceeds to clear the way for me. The dogs are intimidated by his height and decidedly not-defensive posture. They slunk away. I offered an effusive “Thank you, Sir!” and continued jogging home. I was shaken. But felt extraordinarily grateful for the nice, big, calm guy who came to my rescue. More big black guys for my neighborhood, please."

"John drove for many hours while I ate Advil and slept. He’s the man! We arrived in Charlotte around 9:30. This time passing through we stayed with my cousin Mike, his lovely wife Jenn, and their 3 boys. They have the most beautiful house in the world. I mean it. Every room could be on Pinterest. The boys’ rooms look like they are straight out of a Pottery Barn catalogue. Everything is beautiful and inviting and comfortable and spotless and I don’t know how Jenn does it! In the car the next day, as we drove back to Pennsylvania, John and I were both lamenting that our house definitely needs some sprucing up after seeing Mike and Jenn’s house. We started making a list of things we should improve; dirty, stained carpet, gouged linoleum floor, broken doorbell, master bath with half 80’s brassy gold fixtures, half newer brushed nickel fixtures, etc. The list seemed to stretch on and on until finally John sighed and said, “We should have stayed at a Motel 6 and then we would feel like our house was a palace!! So true, so true. But then we drove through Bland and felt better about ourselves."

I have talked with some younger Druzes from the Golan, who told me that their generation felt more connected to Israel, though the older generation wanted to return to Syria. That was some years ago though and I don’t know how it is today, though I don’t think it has changed that much."

To live and work for what looked like at least ten years. Never before in my life had I had a prayer answered. Whats more, I don’t think I wound up in Hawai’i just because its GREEN, I think it was because of Aloha, and how I needed that to help heal my soul too. I know there is two parts to every equation and that I must learn what Hawai’i needs from me as well, and I am learning, but for me Aloha is an answer to a much deeper and more profoundly impactful question, “how do we heal the sickness that is ravaging our world?” The same sickness of people using each other that I escaped from in Vegas and is spreading across the world, I honestly believe the answer is Aloha. I already love this place, and I wound up here for a reason, I’m not an invader, but want to help defend it, and spread its medicine."

"Let me get the bad out of the way first. The trip to Virginia Beach was LONG. Even though we left a little bit before 10PM, we didn't arrive until sometime after 1PM. The funny thing is that my dad actually told me that we made good progress by departing at the time we did. By leaving during the night hours, far less people were on the road. Of course we still weren't spared the curse of idiot drivers. Some crazy lady merging on the highway nearly ran my dad and I off the road."

"RDX, the most lethal and unstable material, was to be placed inside 55-gallon drums in webbing and the drums then were to be filled with a gel substance. The explosives were to be shipped East, to Dulles Airport, marked as ”industrial solvent,” on the first available passenger flights, Mulcahy recalls. Once at Dulles, they were consolidated into one shipping container, along with the timers and the industrial tools and workbenches needed to set up the explosives laboratory in Libya. Then they were forwarded to Europe for transshipment by Lufthansa passenger planes to Tripoli without knowledge of the airline. All of the men involved in the meeting in Washington understood the implications of what they were doing, Mulcahy says: ”The nitro could have blown if the plane hit an air pocket.”"

"Up next was Emma Wild from CBI on the business perspective on IP. She stated that the UK IP regime is respected around the world, and reminded us that many UK industries rely on patents, copyright, and trade marks to protect their designs and creativity. She considered that the Government needs to be a champion for IP and IP rich industries, and advocated collaboration with industry to protect business models which rely on IP. In particular, she spoke against expansion of copyright exceptions that would undermine these business models."

After twelve years, Hans knows very little about himself, except that he does not want to be a grave robber. On the other hand, Angela, the twelve-year-old daughter of the Count and Countess von Schwanenberg knows that she wants to write and perform her marionette plays in all the courts of Europe.

One Japanese sailor was captured."
"And, the atmosphere brings me to the main point as to why we should see more international cricket at Homebush. If we want cricket to grow, it should be accessible to as many people as possible. Last night, there were kids there, probably for their first international cricket match, who would have been locked out by a SCG sellout. The extra capacity of Homebush let’s more people see the game, and it lets more kids have their first experience of the Australian cricket team – and that matters. We can either play more international games at Homebush or have families missing out on really big nights like last night because the SCG is sold out."

"In times long past, the first to live upon this place held great ceremonies and offered grand gestures to the Gods in hopes that the Spring would be long and temperate. Without the conveniences of modern man, small changes to a single new season could mean the difference between life and death for an entire people. Today, those small changes went unnoticed, save by a scattering of those whose job it was to log the specifics of each day and bleary-eyed traders pondering the long or short of it. They had been replaced by larger and more important changes such as the palette, collar-cut, skirt length and proper accessories of the season. They were decried by imagination mavens in four-color glossy explosions laid out across town in patterns so diabolical a Nazi minelayer would be jealous, but failed to reach the people as much as an early storm or late thaw in the last millennium. There were a few that had seen both, but they had long since left judgment behind and could not say which was better."

During those two hours, I was prouder to be a teacher at this school than I have I have ever been proud to be a part of anything. I feel so blessed to be a part of a school that is truly making a difference in students' lives. Making a difference in concrete ways. Making a difference by having a garage sale to earn money to buy two seniors laptops for college. Making a difference by opening the doors to their houses at 10pm to help a student with scholarship essays. Making a difference by demanding excellence because failure is not an option. Making a difference by helping students not just to dream, but to DO. I have some big shoes to fill."

Dasypodius, however, preferred to build a new clock of his own rather than maintain an old one. Over two centuries later, Jean-Baptiste Schwilgue was asked to repair the clock built by Dasypodius, but he decided to build a new and better clock which would last for 10,000 years."

The present author also carried out some unpublished research on the impact of a basic income on the economy on the basis of a social accounting matrix and published some ideas on the basic incomes in the press (Roukens de Lange, 1991). Jeremy Baskin of the Department of Manpower also raised the issue in the press (1993)."

Some people call it the higher state of consciousness, I call it the normal state of consciousness since we are endowed with the ability to live in that state. Meditation helps in two ways-it prevents stress from getting into the system and simultaneously helps release already accumulated stress. Regular meditation also leads to happiness and fulfillment; to sensitisation of the sensory organs (thereby intensifying the experiences of seeing, tasting, feeling, etc.); and to greater intuitiveness."
"If I like sniffing pages of a brand new book, I must say that the steep price has eventually put me off. I favor low prices old books that you can still hunt out in some second-hand bookshops. Travel through time starts there."
"When I was visiting family friends in Sweden a few years ago, I was intrigued to see that the man in the house next door had a robot lawnmower cutting his grass. We don’t see that so much in North America. The Swedes are ahead in other technological fields as well, from attendant-less gas stations, where you’d better know Swedish or else, to banks where a cheque is passed around as a curiosity because so many of the people there had never seen one."

Oh and there’s a few minor parts in there about The Stuff coming to life and killing people…but that doesn’t matter too much…"
"He joins a band of bounty hunters whose activities degenerate to massacre, robbery and rape (the leader Glanton, is based on an actual historical figure and many events in the book have their roots in history).

"It is cut small, so that it doesn’t lace up all the way. That way there is a gap in the front for the heart to show though to the skin. I just used one lace to keep the top up, the heart sits just under it. I used a corset because it gives a lot of support with no shoulder straps, which would spoil the look of the Morrigan costume. Things to be aware of when making or buying a corset for this part… make sure the bottom of the corset doesn’t poke out through the leg openings, and the top goes under the top of the bodysuit in the back. The corset also gives great boob support! Here is what it looks like under the bodysuit –"

"The last time Mercury was retrograde directly opposite your sign was in September 2009. This is always an indication that you have to face old issues with partners, especially ex-partners. It could mean you are similarly dealing with old issues with close friends as well. Whatever the case, all this stuff is back on your plate again. Oy! The downside of Mercury is feeling frustrated with delays. But the upside of Mercury (and incredibly, there is an upside) is that you can quite easily expedite things or finish things or bring them to a conclusion now. Wouldn't it be nice to get rid of this once and for all? Some of you, however, are not dealing with old issues. You're just running into ex-partners -- and all that that implies. (Yikes!)"
"Reading a book about crimes in Chicago."
"Yesterday, we had a district welcome breakfast that included school mascots, four teachers singing karaoke with cardboard guitars, and two moving documentaries about our school. During those two hours, I was prouder to be a teacher at this school than I have I have ever been proud to be a part of anything. I feel so blessed to be a part of a school that is truly making a difference in students' lives. Making a difference in concrete ways. Making a difference by having a garage sale to earn money to buy two seniors laptops for college. Making a difference by opening the doors to their houses at 10pm to help a student with scholarship essays. Making a difference by demanding excellence because failure is not an option. Making a difference by helping students not just to dream, but to DO. I have some big shoes to fill."

"I'd love to tell you that I graciously excused myself from our gathering and quickly walked toward the exit. I'd love to tell you that my leave from the room would have shamed any of Martha Stewart's classes on grace & poise. I'd love to tell you that I'm calm, cool, & collected in emergencies. However - my exit resembled more of a Lucille Ball skit complete with papers flying and my heels flapping as I bolted from the room."

"I spent the last year of my life with a man who told me he thought I was beautiful maybe 5 times at maximum, always made sure I knew there were a million other females that wanted him and drummed into my head that if we broke up I would never do better but he on the other hand would have no problems; whether he used those exact words isn’t relevant. I loved this man, still do; but I realise I put up with a lot of shit because I felt less than I am; funny what a man can do to your self esteem huh!"

They were approaching a break in the trees. That would be his chance – leaping from his horse he would draw an arrow and nail this bitch. Victory would be his and he would feast upon the uncooked innards of his prey. The doe broke cover followed almost immediate by Fuckington.

"The other members of the Crustacea class display “the refracting type eye structure,” which works on completely different principles from those of the reflecting type. Here, the eye is made up of hundreds of cells like a honeycomb. Unlike the square cells in a lobster eye, these cells are either hexagonal or round. Furthermore, instead of reflecting light, small lenses in the cells refract the light onto the focus on the retina."

"We stayed in Chennai for a few days and then decided to get a train to Pondicherry. I had wanted to visit Pondicherry ever since reading a wonderful book, Life of Pi, which begins in that city. Pondicherry is still heavily influenced by all things French as it was formerly a French colony. There are lots of very pretty pastel houses in streets with French names and in fact the city is divided into the French quarter and the Indian quarter and lots of people living there speak in French, which was bit disconcerting! It sits beside the Bay of Bengal and has lovely stretches of clean beaches and plenty of interesting shops. It`s known as a holiday get away for Indians and we liked it so much we stopped there for several days. Indian women go paddling in their sari`s and it`s just incredibly rich and colourful to see. The police, many of them women, wear uniforms of pale and dark blue camouflage. One time I bought some candy floss from a guy on the beach and a police officer came up to him rapping his knuckle with her baton, she told him to give me more bags and that he had ripped me off, as if I really minded. The only strange event I witnessed was when a very, very old lady came on to the beach, she was filthy dirty and obviously had some sort of mental health issue. Smiling and laughing to herself, she slowly twirled around on the sand then gradually lifting her swirling skirts she sank to the beach and poo`d. Nobody seemed to mind and that`s India for you."

"Many of us think of name brands such as Microsoft or Apple Macintosh, when we think of owning a PC, but it all starts with the humble computer tower, where motherboards nurse their internal hardware to external peripherals.

"When I was growing up this was a very common dish in my house. My Mom would make this super-simple fried tofu at least twice a week as a snack, an appetizer, or a side dish in a larger Asian-style meal. When I visit my mother in Atlanta we eat it at every evening meal. We’ve been eating this same tofu dish for years and years because it is utterly delicious and surprisingly addictive. The mild curd develops unexpected flavors (sweet, a little sour, a little nutty) when fried, and the crisp edges give it textural interest and a nice chew. Dipped in something as simple as soy sauce, maybe with a little fiery chili paste in it, the little soy bean curd pillows are delightfully fun to eat as you pop them in your mouth. When I married Regina I discovered that she too loves this dish, which made me realize anew that fried tofu is ubiquitous in Asia. Fried tofu eclipses class and culture and politics — pretty much everyone who eats it loves it. Certainly my whole family loves it, including my tofu-obsessed father and my eight-year old son Bennet."
"If Tengku is to be an ordinary ‘wakil rakyat’, Tengku should please let the rulers know that Malaysia is an embarrassment because of the Constitution.

I take silky ribbons that I keep every year and after 'wrapping' it like you would with paper I wrap it with the ribbon. Sometimes I'll pull it up and have this poof of fabric with a big bow. That looks nice for the solid colors. I'll take some pictures of ours to share with ya'll and hopefully you can use the idea next year. Remember...after Christmas sells!"

Instead, whites are commonly portrayed as the authors of suffering and hardship.

"As the verse reads, the centurion ran away out of sheer fear but the chief captain, because of his position had to face up to him. Then by way of the fact that he had Paul bound, he had an additional worry. If this action got back to Rome he would be in dire straits. It could cost him his citizenship or perhaps his life."
"On the bus we are briefed not to help the children climb trees or to find the solution for them but allow them to sort out their own problems. Christa gives the example of a new member of staff who came out for the first time and saw a child trying to fish a plastic bag out of the stream with a short stick. The adult gave the child a longer stick and said 'here try this'. Christa says this experience meant that the child did not get to make the learning that was possible in this situation. There was so much more learning that could have happened without the adults intervention."
"Then — the 1980s and 1990s — as now, clerics on Saudi TV were obsessed with women and their orifices, especially what came out of them. I’ll never forget hearing that if a baby boy urinated on you, you could go ahead and pray in the same clothes, yet if a baby girl peed on you, you had to change. What on Earth in the girl’s urine made you impure? I wondered."

"In South Africa, today, being white means to cross the T's and dot the I's of political correctness, to silently assume the role of the historically guilty and to never question or criticize the new establishment's intentions. Ranging from board meetings to retail store queues, you have to pretend that you subscribe to the new 'moral' order. The notion is that whites have never suffered and that they cannot be victims. Instead, whites are commonly portrayed as the authors of suffering and hardship. This politically correct dogma has turned into an unprecedented form of Orwellian Thought Policing, not even experienced under apartheid."

"By the time she was 14, her parents sought help from a top-notch Psychiatrist. His diagnosis? ODD (oppositional defiant disorder). This meant that Ashley had trouble with authority, nothing more. She was in therapy for this with the same doctor for a year, and only seemed to worsen in that time. Her grades were all failing by the time she entered high school, and she began skipping classes. Eventually, she no longer attended and the private school had her suspended permanently."
"Completely opposite the saison, this beer was awesome looking. Deep purple almost black and lovely stillness to it. They didn't say how long this was aged in the barrel but it was aged on black wishniak cherries (hence the name) during that time. Pretty sour nose but not as much vinegar as the Phruit Phunk. Started sour up front followed by a huge, sweet black cherry flavor. If you've ever had a black cherry soda, then you have an idea how this one finished. Just tons of black cherry flavor which grew as I drank more. Really great. This was Jo's favorite of the event I believe."
"Springsteen often talks of a conversation he’s having with the fans. He repeatedly says he wants to continue that conversation—through recorded and live music. It’s more than a conversation. The editor of this collection gets it right: “In a very real sense, Springsteen’s body of work can also be viewed that way, as an ongoing exploration, via popular song, of the very heart of the American psyche.”"

"It’s not a time to think, what else could I be eating for more variety or mouth happiness? And eating any off-product food during Phase 1 can be a slippery slope.

"For instance, we learn that in the sixteenth century Conrad Dasypodius, a Swiss mathematician, could have chosen to restore the old Clock of the Three Kings in Strasbourg Cathedral. Dasypodius, however, preferred to build a new clock of his own rather than maintain an old one. Over two centuries later, Jean-Baptiste Schwilgue was asked to repair the clock built by Dasypodius, but he decided to build a new and better clock which would last for 10,000 years."

"As I watch my son sleeping now, nine years later, I am amazed at this child who came so dramatically into the world. My 7lb 3oz baby who litterally got stuck, has not been stuck ever again. A child who gave his older brother the courage to face fears. A little boy who had excema on his face and a ready smile to all he met. A baby who did not toddle, but ran. A child who still bursts forth head first into things in life. A sensitive guy who many people misinterpret. A little boy who is more like me than I sometimes want to acknowledge. I sit here, nine years later, and thank God for the lessons Cullen has taught me. From learning to love another child, to watching brothers grow with one arm slung around the other's shoulders. From early morning feedings where it is just baby and Mommy, to double stroller walks with Daddy. Somewhere along the way he potty trained in one day, learned to read, tie his shoes, and will be entering the 4th grade. His peaceful sleeping face reflects not only the child he was, but the man he will become, with God's grace."

"The plants need a lot of caring and nurturing for them to grow right. Watering them morning and afternoon, cultivating the soil and checking them regularly are some ways to help the plants grow. For the garden to come into completion, one should not just plant and wait doing nothing. Same is true with our lives, we all have dreams and things that we want to accomplish, but we will not see them turn into reality if we just wait and do nothing. We have to make steps for them to be fulfilled. Planning without right implementation produces nothing. Nurture and do things that add-up to the realization of the vision."
"Pierre and I talked about plans for the children. He said their building was basically untouched but they were afraid to put the children back in as aftershocks continue to periodically hit the city. He was also concerned about food, water, and safety…the same things everyone else is struggling with at this moment. After our talk I drove around the city searching for large bags of water I could bring the kids. After an hour of driving I returned with 80 tiny bags of water. It was all I could find, but it was completely insufficient for the 175 or so children and workers."

"One hundred years ago, 'wireless telegraphy' was mostly used to communicate with vessels crossing the Atlantic Ocean.

I gave up before I reached 40, so I remember all the pleasure cigarettes give the young but none of the downsides, which show themselves later on in life. However, for all the wonders of the world He created, it is surely evidence of a somewhat perverse sense of humour on the part of the maker that so much in life which gives you pleasure, is either bad for you, or makes you fat. There are surely few experiences more dismal than an entirely healthy lifestyle, and that seems rather unfair."

"As to the names issue, the North tended to call battles and armies after bodies of water, and the South would pick the nearest town or other man-made feature in selecting names, so Manassas Junction was what they called the battle of Bull Run after, and this trend then continued on with many other battles. Fredericksburg is called the same by both north and south."

Whats more, I don’t think I wound up in Hawai’i just because its GREEN, I think it was because of Aloha, and how I needed that to help heal my soul too. I know there is two parts to every equation and that I must learn what Hawai’i needs from me as well, and I am learning, but for me Aloha is an answer to a much deeper and more profoundly impactful question, “how do we heal the sickness that is ravaging our world?” The same sickness of people using each other that I escaped from in Vegas and is spreading across the world, I honestly believe the answer is Aloha. I already love this place, and I wound up here for a reason, I’m not an invader, but want to help defend it, and spread its medicine."

Now I can pick and chose when I want to work. Which works out much better for our family!"

"Punk fans at the time couldn't imagine the results of this band, most definitely they certainly couldn't have foreseen this bladerunner styled concept album about a teenager who stumbles onto an ex-CIA agents tapes all about who really runs world affairs, as Dr. Beter details. Razor sharp guitars, searing torches including acoustic guitars. ""No Dreams"" lays out an agenda that would loom large in Bator's next band. The rest of the album runs similarly bleak. Without a doubt, ""Ready To Snap"" is the highlight of the album and is a battle cry to commence the boot boys to teenage war. The sophistication of this work has never been properly honored, seems to have never hit,, bellowing over the heads of many a punk."

However, sadly, I find myself BACK in Kansas City - wherein I just left not five days ago - as my mother has become seriously ill.

"After breaking free from my somewhat sheltered and slightly ignorant small town country life I started working in a German owned automotive company. This came after I left a management position in a pharmacy chain in my bold attempt to explore new possibilities. It was humbling, because this job I went to was a production job, but they paid for my college. The production job was perfect for me, because there was no stress. I only had to work, which allowed me to save all my brain power for the college classes. The most valuable part of the experience was my introduction to new cultures. Of course Germans had a strong presence there, but many others as well. I made my first black friends there because the small town from which I came was 99.99% white. I made a few new Latin friends from Mexico and South America and a few Asian friends as well."

"The last time Mercury was retrograde directly opposite your sign was in September 2009. This is always an indication that you have to face old issues with partners, especially ex-partners. It could mean you are similarly dealing with old issues with close friends as well. Whatever the case, all this stuff is back on your plate again. Oy! The downside of Mercury is feeling frustrated with delays. But the upside of Mercury (and incredibly, there is an upside) is that you can quite easily expedite things or finish things or bring them to a conclusion now. Wouldn't it be nice to get rid of this once and for all? Some of you, however, are not dealing with old issues. You're just running into ex-partners -- and all that that implies. (Yikes!)"

"We become so used to what is presented as beauty in our culture that it is easy to become confused about God's design for beauty in women. I once read a Christian author who believed that a reasonable amount of time to spend on her appearance was a tithe amount - 10% of her day. That would be at least an hour and a half each day. It seems to me that God has an awful lot of work for us to do in the world that could be done with an extra ten and a half hours per week."

Apart from a few scant touches by McEntire on percussion, the tracks are arranged for guitar and bass only or for piano and bass (in rare exceptions voice too). What sets this music apart isn't so much its bare arrangements, but rather the ambiguous incongruities in its harmony."

"Oxford in Faulkner’s day was a quaint stop in the North Mississippi hill country on the Illinois Central Railroad line. Mainly, the Oxford stop was to move cotton and students around. A relatively new town by Eastern standards, Oxford as a white settlement goes back only to 1836, when Lafayette County was one of thirteen counties created by the state legislature. But before that, the area had been home to the Chickasaw and earlier groups for around twelve thousand years. In 1837, three men purchased fifty acres for a town from two Chickasaws, Hoka and E Ah Nah Yea, who no doubt saw the writing on the wall: The site was on the Trail of Tears, along which a year later Native Americans would be forced to leave their home and march westward."

"WWII is entering its last phase: Germany is in ruins, but does not yield. The US army lacks crucial knowledge about the German units operating on the opposite side of the Rhine, and decides to send two German prisoners to gather information. The scheme is risky: the Gestapo retains a terribly efficient network to identify and capture spies and deserters. Moreover, it is not clear that “Tiger”, who does not mind any dirty work as long as the price is right, and war-weary “Happy”, who might be easily betrayed by his feelings, are dependable agents. After Tiger and another American agent are successfully infiltrated, Happy is parachuted in Bavaria. His duty: find out the whereabouts of a powerful German armored unit moving towards the western front."
"In this respect, sinister role of Indian RAW could also be judged from some other events of sectarian violence. In 2008, in Khyber Agency, intermittent fighting between Lashkar-e-Islam and Ansar-ul-Islam had claimed as many as 1500 lives. Lashkar Islami is led by fanatic cleric Mangal Bagh who follows the puritanical Deobandi form of Sunni Islam and has close connections with the extremist Taliban of Afghanistan. Besides other areas of Pakistan, more than 2000 people died in sectarian riots in Kurram Agency, bordering Afghanistan. Its areas have been hit by fierce clashes, pitching Sunni Muslims against the minority Shias. A number of ceasefires was concluded between the warring sects with the help of government officials and the tribal Maliks, but the same proved fruitless owing to the support from Afghanistan where more than hundred training centers covertly established by RAW are supervising anti-Pakistan activities with the tactical help CIA and Mossad."

"Finally, as if anyone in Leeds needs reminding - CAMRA's Leeds Beer Festival is taking place now. If its tips you're after, I can wholeheartedly recommend Hopstar's Smokey Joe Black Beer and Thornbridge's Chiron. Leeds's Gyle 479 was sitting in wooden glory amongst the rows of plastic and steel, and the beer was excellent; with a much more pungent, rum/whisky-esque nose than the plummy delights of the bottled version. I understand this has now run out, but I think there are still some bottles kicking around."
"Sorvino does nothing but flirt with Nicole, presented in such detail that the film practically becomes a romantic comedy for a short period. Because that’s really what I wanted in a movie called The Stuff; a fat balding middle aged man hitting on a woman. Truly they picked the right focus for this picture. Oh and there’s a few minor parts in there about The Stuff coming to life and killing people…but that doesn’t matter too much…"
"As a runner, I am the same way. When things are going well and I am oh so happy about life, I do not run as fast and I do not push myself. I just jog along in la-la land noticing the flowers and birds chirping.

"The man who has lived in this house for several years is the grandson of the farmer who built it, and it was passed down three generations to the degenerate who has let the thing go to hell. OK, to be fair, his mother wasn’t much better. When she owned the house, she would decorate the lawn for the seasons and then leave everything up all year—Christmas lights, a plywood cutout of Santa riding a rocket, a hay bale with pumpkins in various stages of decay, plastic Easter eggs hanging from the lower branches of the scraggly trees. Trick-or-treating kids would walk an arc around the place to avoid it on Halloween."

"The culturing of meditation into our system is normal. Some people call it the higher state of consciousness, I call it the normal state of consciousness since we are endowed with the ability to live in that state. Meditation helps in two ways-it prevents stress from getting into the system and simultaneously helps release already accumulated stress. Regular meditation also leads to happiness and fulfillment; to sensitisation of the sensory organs (thereby intensifying the experiences of seeing, tasting, feeling, etc.); and to greater intuitiveness."

"I saw people get out wheelchairs in 1970 in just a few weeks after starting L-DOPA (which had just been released in the USA) for their Parkinson’s disease. Could anything remotely similar happen in Alzheimer’s disease? I think it’s possible if the problems with thinking and forming new memories are due to the senile cluttering up the brain (a very big if). First, more than just a little bit of neuroanatomic and neurophysiologic background."

Then it is too late, in many cases."

"The honest answer is; apart from the web, we’re not entirely sure how we’re going to do this yet. This is something traditional publishers do as part of the process for each book and possibly another appealing aspect of traditional publishers. But I’ve also heard they can do very little to push a book, so it’s a tough one to call."

"Jane Dystel, President of Dystel & Goderich Literary Management"
"Besides the health, financial, and environmental reasons, there is of course the ethical reason. Is it correct that 70 Billion animals are raised each year only to become food for humans? The vast majority of these animals live lives of such unimaginable squalor and suffering as to dull the senses. There seems to be a widespread idea that animals, for some reason, don’t feel pain or suffering like humans, or that they only exist to feed humans. These are such juvenile ideas that they would almost be laughable if they weren’t so repugnant. Notwithstanding the active abuse dished out to untold numbers of animals and the horrible conditions that they inhabit during their short, sad lives, the worst part of this issue is the fact that most humans feel that there is nothing wrong in our very mentally which justifies the slavery and subservience of all other animals to our appetites and whims, and that humans are naturally superior and ordained to dominate and rule the earth because we are the most intelligent species. This is an example of an intelligence I want no part of. We are animals too, and this slavery and abuse is unacceptable and should not be tolerated or even allowed."

"About 2 weeks ago I was looking at Art House Co-Op when a theme, Stitches and Folds, caught my eye and suddenly I was thinking clearly about drawing and note making that might lead to the creation of some textile work. I knew straight away how to work with this theme, both as a sketchbook for the project and as the basis of new work of my own, so I signed up. I’ve been transported back several decades to when I was doing needlework as a school subject and the endless samples of seams, tuck, pleats and darts that had to be worked. Suddenly I was seeing a mixed media sketchbook and larger textile pieces celebrating this functional stitching. My initial initial sketchbook is a very basic one I had on hand that has just kicked off my thinking and enabled me to get some simple preliminary thoughts down."

The members reside in 36 villages in a remote area around Bristol Bay, Alaska. We are seeking a full-time Fellow to reside in Dillingham, Alaska, where BBNA is headquartered, for 9 months, from September 2012 through May 2013. The Fellow will travel to villages with BBNA staff to meet with clients and provide estate planning services. The Fellow will be supervised by Center personnel and will have on-site contact with an Alaska Legal Services attorney. This is a unique opportunity for a recent law school graduate to gain hands-on legal experience in a unique location! BBNA members have special estate planning needs, and the Fellow will undergo training on those special needs, as well as estate planning for native Alaskans.

"Friedman wrote: Under the limited standard for SEQRA review, the court is constrained to hold that ESDC’s elaboration of its reasons for using the 10 year build-out and for not requiring an SEIS was not irrational as a matter of law. ESDC's continuing use of the 10 year build-out was supported—albeit, in this court’s opinion, only minimally—by the factors articulated by ESDC. ESDC did not, for reasons that are unexplained to this date, expressly state, in the documentation prepared in connection with its review of the 2009 plan, that the MTA agreement permitted FCRC to defer acquisition until 2030 of air rights necessary to complete construction of various buildings called for in Phase II of the Project. Contrary to petitioners’ contention, however, the documentation of ESDC’s review unquestionably demonstrates, as found above, that ESDC categorized the MTA agreement as a “major change” to the Project… and was aware of the MTA installment through 2030."

I feel so blessed to be a part of a school that is truly making a difference in students' lives. Making a difference in concrete ways. Making a difference by having a garage sale to earn money to buy two seniors laptops for college. Making a difference by opening the doors to their houses at 10pm to help a student with scholarship essays. Making a difference by demanding excellence because failure is not an option. Making a difference by helping students not just to dream, but to DO. I have some big shoes to fill."

"I find it hard to be critical of a surplus budget brought down by a Leftist government. I never thought to see such a thing in my lifetime. And the fact that the surplus was partly achieved by welfare cuts is all the more amazing. And even the defence cuts did not involve any reduction in personnel numbers. And allowing for business losses to be carried backwards as well as forwards is both innovative and potentially very helpful to business. And lifting the tax-free threshold was WAY overdue."

Everyone who is now 70 was once 25 and the majority of those who are 25 now will be 70 some day"". In other words, ""we can screw you now because we didn't screw you earlier; and if we're not screwing you now, wait until you're 70 and then you'll really be screwed."" The implications are obvious: if a twenty-something needs a liver or kidney transplant and a suitable donor person below 10 or over 50 (judging by Emanuel's chart) is available, these ethics standards say go ahead and kill the kid or kill the grandma and get the working ""unit"" back to work so ""it"" can make money and pay taxes to the mighty Fed.gov hydra."

I turned the pieces upside down, shuffled them and then set them aside for a moment. Then, I told my students a few true stories. I told them stories of how I had come to find respect and trust in our learning space. I thanked my principal and asked her to step out. Then, slowly, with honesty and love, I drew one piece of paper at a time. Slow, as I read each name in turn, I thanked each student for the gifts they have offered me over the last 9 weeks. We cried. And we spent the rest of the day laughing, awash in tears, gratitude and reflection."
"Friedman wrote: Under the limited standard for SEQRA review, the court is constrained to hold that ESDC’s elaboration of its reasons for using the 10 year build-out and for not requiring an SEIS was not irrational as a matter of law. ESDC's continuing use of the 10 year build-out was supported—albeit, in this court’s opinion, only minimally—by the factors articulated by ESDC. ESDC did not, for reasons that are unexplained to this date, expressly state, in the documentation prepared in connection with its review of the 2009 plan, that the MTA agreement permitted FCRC to defer acquisition until 2030 of air rights necessary to complete construction of various buildings called for in Phase II of the Project. Contrary to petitioners’ contention, however, the documentation of ESDC’s review unquestionably demonstrates, as found above, that ESDC categorized the MTA agreement as a “major change” to the Project… and was aware of the MTA installment through 2030."

They're easier to carry, easier to store and quicker to cool. I'm led to believe than aluminium is a much better recycling material than glass, so they're green too. They certainly take up a lot less space when empty (and crushed)."

He didn’t bother looking at the time, by the way the professor looked around, he knew the bell was going to ring in any minute. Then, he’d be able to go and fix any problem his family had that day.

Well, yes, but this was a different store with different stock, and I was hurting after my first physiotherapy appointment. I also came home with a bundle of super-nostalgic sweets from the old-fashioned sweet emporium, so you can see what kind of mood I was in. Anyway, Arlene Russo's The Real Twilight: True Stories of Modern Day Vampires was the first book I saw, and for £1.99 I thought it might be interesting to see just how far weird vamp-obsession can go. Cash, Johnny Cash's famous autobiography, was tucked under a heap of other books so I plucked that out as well. And just as we were about to leave, I spotted a hardcover copy of Karl Pilkington's An Idiot Abroad hidden behind a big display. I think he's hilarious but his books are usually so darn expensive, so £4.99 seemed a pretty good deal!"

Depending on the results of that will determine our next course of action. On the low side we will just keep doing what we are doing and then on the high side she would have to have a transplant.

"BHtL weren't cookie-cutter punks, but some of the more ""routine"" songs in their repertoire (""Violet Actions,"" ""Tar and Feather,"" ""Northern Colony,"" etc) certainly bordered that periphery. Fortunately they compensated with a generous amount of diversity among quite a few of the remaining numbers, most startlingly in the shape of the relatively ambient instrumental ""Desert Song."" The quartet saves their aces for the second half of the show, with two particular standouts. ""Poetry"" exhibits serious power pop flirtations a la a rawer, more muscular Mitch Easter production. It gets better. ""What I Believe"" is this tape's crown jewel, bearing a classic Bob Mould-inspired guitar workout, nearly passing for a primo Metal Circus or Zen Arcade outtake. Brilliant. Luckily. these two numbers appear on side two (tracks 7-12), which sounds demonstrably more lucid than this tape's preceding first half which is far too muffled and bassy. I tried to play around with the equalization, but all the tweaking in the world won't substitute for a cleaner tape. There's yet another snag, and a fairly significant one at that. When the reel on side two ends, so does the last tune (""When Mommy Comes Home Drunk"") midstream. Even so, you get a good ninety seconds of it."

If it’s so unimportant, then why do they care? Hahaha."
"I’ve only ever written novels, though I wouldn’t mind a tilt at TV one day. They are very different media which is why you need to change things, substantially sometimes, when you transfer stories between them. Novels work on the imagination and, if they succeed, take the reader directly into the story. TV is a passive medium in which the screen is the boss and says ‘Watch now’ until it’s done. And you have actors in TV – wonderful actors in the case of The Killing, which means they can get away with unresolved narrative issues which would never be allowed in a book. TV has a visceral immediacy and the ability to mix the visual, the auditory and the dramatic in a way that can root you to the spot. Books are more subtle it seems to me, and ultimately more memorable. My take on The Killing departs from the TV version in some very significant ways, especially at the end. But it’s been interesting that some devoted Killing followers haven’t spotted that. It’s because TV is very much of the moment, I suspect. You’re a spectator, not a participant as you are in a good book. That said I’d still like to write TV before long – it’s such an adventurous and ambitious medium in the right hands."

"“Two men are enemies,” the Corsican said. “They decide to kill each other. One is big. The other is small. They fight with fists. The small man cannot get near the big man. The small man is the most nimble. But the big man chases him. Eventually, he should catch him, and kill him. Now give to each man a knife. The small man is still at a disadvantage. The big man has more reach. It’s difficult to penetrate his wide guard. But the small man is the more nimble. His thrusts are the quicker. And knife-fighting is a question of courage. Perhaps the big one feels faint when he thinks he may die. Or when he sees blood. The battle is more even. It is more dirty to fight with fists than with knives. To attack another man with fists is a dirty trick, requiring little courage, but only bestial strength.” This Corsican was biased, being an expert with the knife he carried and ate and shaved with. It was a long curving blade, with a delicately curved, black bone handle, I recall. But I thoroughly agreed, and agree with his sentiments. To hell with adventure novelists who decry every man who draws a knife and lionise honest John who fights with his fists."

My personal favourite is the ecclectic trash look which basically involves taking every element of appearance from skin to shoe and trying to make it as trashy as possible."

This is something traditional publishers do as part of the process for each book and possibly another appealing aspect of traditional publishers. But I’ve also heard they can do very little to push a book, so it’s a tough one to call."
"In any case the government has only Thursday and Friday to get the Bill through in this session because on Monday the House is scheduled to discuss the maha-controversial Lokpal Bill and the day after that i.e. 22nd is the last day of the present budget session. This would mean that the Copyright Bill would be shunted to the monsoon session."

"So what is the LEED-PAC? Is it what it seems? Why have its listed proponents and financial backers ‘flocked together’? Do they have a stereotypical commonality, other than pure altruism? Could the LEED-PAC actually be a grouping of individuals who have vested financial or other interests in the outcomes of the coming elections, both in May and in November? One typecast observation is that the LEED-PAC is about maintaining a certain degree of control on economic development in LeeCounty; are they the so-called ‘establishment good ole boys’? Many of the LEED-PAC people have heavy financial interest in how development will transpire in the County. That doesn’t sound altruistic, rather it sounds eerily like keeping control on how money is made and who gets to make it. It also sound eerily like it entails how public tax dollars are spent, and who gets to benefit from that spending. Is the LEED-PAC a ‘Trayvon hoodie’ hiding something unknown, with unknown intent? Maybe it’s time to know just how innocent or sinister this group is. Perhaps someone will publish a column exposing just who these shadowy LEED-PAC people are and identify the businesses they run. Inquiring minds want to know."
"That’s $107/hr as a couple or $53.50/hr per person. And to earn that much after taxes you’d really have to earn $612; money saved (by not having to spend it) is actually worth more than we realize when the government’s cut is taken into consideration."

"Quality is of such importance to Connor that he has page on the Bier Brewery website dedicated to his promise to produce quality beers. And he says he will not sell an inferior product. To prove his point, he tweeted yesterday that he had dumped batch #40 down the drain for not meeting quality expectations."
"Sorvino does nothing but flirt with Nicole, presented in such detail that the film practically becomes a romantic comedy for a short period. Because that’s really what I wanted in a movie called The Stuff; a fat balding middle aged man hitting on a woman. Truly they picked the right focus for this picture. Oh and there’s a few minor parts in there about The Stuff coming to life and killing people…but that doesn’t matter too much…"
"Now that school is back in session, niece Emma is spending her days with us again. She arrives about 7:30, well before Frank and Chloe wake up, so she and I spend the mornings chatting, just we two.

"There was a lot of silence (as you might imagine). Then, I heard from a couple families. I wasn't experienced with this. Both eventually said no. I heard a lot of opinions. I was told to let him die peacefully in DRC. I was told that there wasn't much of a chance for him, that no one would adopt a child with a likely death sentence. It was a dark time. I really felt like I wasn't supposed to give up on him, despite how crazy it sounded and everyone telling me to let it go. Yet, doors weren't opening.

"So, we get past the jokes and we do small talk for a few minutes. The dude then admits that he was a good krumper and can show me the moves, right on the train. I get way too excited over this, because I love love love hip hop dance and admire any of those bitches who do it and do it well. He’s a recreational krumper. Then instead of krumping, he continues chatting. So I say,”Uh, are you gonna get your krump on or what?”"
"This picture is a very special souvenir from my University graduation way back in 1996. I really enjoyed my 5 years at University studying as an English major, but i was SO excited to finally graduate and start a new chapter of my life. They often say that no matter the experience, most important are the people you meet and the friends you make along the way... Well, i was truly blessed to have met Line during my 2nd year at University and for the next 4 years, we were almost inseparable. She quickly became one of my dearest friends, my 'Partner in Crime' as we liked to call each other back then. Nowadays, we don't get to see each other or talk that often, but she will always hold a very special place in my heart and will always be at the top of the list, where best friends are concerned!"

And then all the things that took them a day to pack will take me 3+ months to unpack***, something which makes me rather sad."

"Processed foods like deli meats contain a lot of sodium, which can interrupt sleep by raising your blood pressure and dehydrating you, Cornell’s Maas says. Caffeine, meanwhile, stays in your system for up to 12 hours, so the effects of a p.m. latte could linger till midnight. Try skipping the joe tomorrow: Not having caffeine for a single day can improve sleep quality that night, a study in the Journal of Clinical Nursing found."

Even with her sassiness, spicey-iness, whatever, I just love her. I love being around her. We have so much fun 99.7% of the time. Her sass tends to be more funny than anything else. It’s so awesome.

"We could also say that just by being born you have committed to being on this planet, which is in itself a bid for power. Many of you out there are still a bit ambivalent about that one, and until you truly commit to being here, spirit will not support you in the most powerful way. You could say it was not your choice to be here, your parents decided it for you and so on… That is giving your power away and allowing Martyrdom to rule. The Martyrdom we have plaguing us this year is actually providing us with an opportunity to eliminate the inner victim by taking responsibility for our lives and our bids for power, and committing to what we want through our actions as adults. We also need to stop blaming others for things that don’t work out."
"The only other thing to say is that this is the 100th post for Whittering On. I've been trying to figure out why I'm not all Woo-Hoo and super-duper excited, running competitions, hosting parties and whatnot but the truth is, it's not my 100th post. I had that last year sometime on my other (now closed to the public) blog and there was fireworks and champagne. Actually this turns out to be my 219th post.

"I saw people get out wheelchairs in 1970 in just a few weeks after starting L-DOPA (which had just been released in the USA) for their Parkinson’s disease. Could anything remotely similar happen in Alzheimer’s disease? I think it’s possible if the problems with thinking and forming new memories are due to the senile cluttering up the brain (a very big if). First, more than just a little bit of neuroanatomic and neurophysiologic background."

"Then — the 1980s and 1990s — as now, clerics on Saudi TV were obsessed with women and their orifices, especially what came out of them.

What on Earth in the girl’s urine made you impure? I wondered."

"Calculus is still a very timid group, extra afraid of being wrong slash anyone knowing they are wrong, but had lots of fun looking into the ""there are always two antipodal points on a great circle at the same temperature"" thing today. (Which true confession I'm not totally sure is a good use of Intermediate Value Theorem day but I kind of suspect is it, so I went with it.) There was a distinct, entrenched camp arguing ""no,"" and a diverse, poorly-organized camp valiantly arguing ""yes,"" and the ""no's"" were very gracious when they realized their position was untenable."

"But it is too simplistic to claim that government support is the only reason China has had some B2B success. The strength of the country’s scientific and technical talent is growing, and local companies increasingly bring real capabilities to the table. What’s more, a number of government-supported innovation efforts have not been successful. Some notable examples include attempts to develop an indigenous 3G telecommunications protocol called TDS-CDMA and to replace the global Wi-Fi standard with a China-only Internet security protocol, WAPI."

"What this means it that the bacteria use a small amount of energy (2 electrons) and two hydrogen ions to create ammonium hydroxide and water. Then they convert the ammonium hydroxide into nitrites, 5 hydrogen ions, and more energy (4 electrons). It’s not very efficient, but it’s enough for these bacteria to live on. Note that there are 5 hydrogen ions produced for every 2 ions used… this increases the acidity of the water."

After all, in terms of quality the taste of vampire blood is generally more satisfying, more complex and bolder in its flavour than that of a normal, unconverted human being.

"In this system, it's acceptable to let a 70 year old, die while giving care to a 25 year old, because their life is worth more to the collective - excuse me - worth more to society. To paraphrase their quote, ""it's not discrimination to deny care to the 70 year old and give it to the 25 year old. Everyone who is now 70 was once 25 and the majority of those who are 25 now will be 70 some day"". In other words, ""we can screw you now because we didn't screw you earlier; and if we're not screwing you now, wait until you're 70 and then you'll really be screwed."" The implications are obvious: if a twenty-something needs a liver or kidney transplant and a suitable donor person below 10 or over 50 (judging by Emanuel's chart) is available, these ethics standards say go ahead and kill the kid or kill the grandma and get the working ""unit"" back to work so ""it"" can make money and pay taxes to the mighty Fed.gov hydra."

"This was a surmountable operational difficulty presented by the linguistic differences between people who were visually indistinguishable. But when we consider the nature of our Muslim Troubles, we see immediately that operating undercover in this fashion is not going to be possible to any significant extent. Nearly all of the Muslims in the UK are something other than white, and nearly everyone in the British army is white. This means that putting together a Det-style army unit to go and prowl around in Muslim areas will be impossible, as there will be no significant pool of suitable people in the army to recruit from for the purpose. It will surely not be beyond the ken of Muslims to see that mysterious white converts to Islam who start coming into their areas may not be exactly what they seem. This is what we will call the mutual impermeability problem, a problem which will bedevil the efforts of all parties to the conflict one way or another. It will be one of the biggest and most significant differences between the Troubles and our forthcoming Muslim Troubles."

"The man who has lived in this house for several years is the grandson of the farmer who built it, and it was passed down three generations to the degenerate who has let the thing go to hell. OK, to be fair, his mother wasn’t much better. When she owned the house, she would decorate the lawn for the seasons and then leave everything up all year—Christmas lights, a plywood cutout of Santa riding a rocket, a hay bale with pumpkins in various stages of decay, plastic Easter eggs hanging from the lower branches of the scraggly trees. Trick-or-treating kids would walk an arc around the place to avoid it on Halloween."

"This morning, second period, with my principal in the room, I had each student and my principal write their name on a piece of paper. I turned the pieces upside down, shuffled them and then set them aside for a moment. Then, I told my students a few true stories. I told them stories of how I had come to find respect and trust in our learning space. I thanked my principal and asked her to step out. Then, slowly, with honesty and love, I drew one piece of paper at a time. Slow, as I read each name in turn, I thanked each student for the gifts they have offered me over the last 9 weeks. We cried. And we spent the rest of the day laughing, awash in tears, gratitude and reflection."

"In conclusion, it’s interesting to watch these self-publishers go commercial. I don’t think any of them have succeeded as much as they did with self-publishing; it’s probably because a) the process was rushed and somewhat ignored because the books already have found its audience and should therefore go on the market ASAP and b) these authors just weren’t built for commercial publication. Their books weren’t, either, which is probably why they didn’t go that route (for whatever reason) in the first place."

"Obviously, America is not a post-racist country. The blurry line dividing the other two appellations — racism and racialism — is crossed daily in overt and subtle ways. The line’s vagueness and the sometimes inadvertent crossing of it reflect the very different American experiences of blacks and whites. The recent shooting death in Sanford,Florida, of unarmed, 17-year-old Trayvon Martin by a self-appointed neighborhood watch captain, for instance, was seen by many blacks as another instance of racial profiling. But feelings of outrage and sadness and a demand for justice crossed all racial borders."

"2. Find a flesh and blood group of peers who you can dialog with. I prefer faith communities. Though not without their perils, they assume deeper meaning in the universe and attempt to process the challenges of living through that understanding. This lends itself to hope, and perseverance. Sometimes—especially in the storm, that is everything you need to make it through. You don’t need to agree with everything they say or think or do. You simply need them. Go out, meet your neighbors, invest at a local club, try a church or synagogue or mosque. Find fellowship with those around you."

"Normally it isn’t that weird to see Jews and Druzes in a positive relation, but this case differs, since the Druze youths are from Majdal Shams, which is situated in the Golan, next to the Syrian border, and many of the Druzes there holds great sympathy for Syria, at least among the older generation. I have talked with some younger Druzes from the Golan, who told me that their generation felt more connected to Israel, though the older generation wanted to return to Syria. That was some years ago though and I don’t know how it is today, though I don’t think it has changed that much."

"As I watch my son sleeping now, nine years later, I am amazed at this child who came so dramatically into the world. My 7lb 3oz baby who litterally got stuck, has not been stuck ever again. A child who gave his older brother the courage to face fears. A little boy who had excema on his face and a ready smile to all he met. A baby who did not toddle, but ran. A child who still bursts forth head first into things in life. A sensitive guy who many people misinterpret. A little boy who is more like me than I sometimes want to acknowledge. I sit here, nine years later, and thank God for the lessons Cullen has taught me. From learning to love another child, to watching brothers grow with one arm slung around the other's shoulders. From early morning feedings where it is just baby and Mommy, to double stroller walks with Daddy. Somewhere along the way he potty trained in one day, learned to read, tie his shoes, and will be entering the 4th grade. His peaceful sleeping face reflects not only the child he was, but the man he will become, with God's grace."

"For instance, we learn that in the sixteenth century Conrad Dasypodius, a Swiss mathematician, could have chosen to restore the old Clock of the Three Kings in Strasbourg Cathedral. Dasypodius, however, preferred to build a new clock of his own rather than maintain an old one. Over two centuries later, Jean-Baptiste Schwilgue was asked to repair the clock built by Dasypodius, but he decided to build a new and better clock which would last for 10,000 years."

They were over by the kitty litter, which was (as I mentioned before) in the girl's section. Yeah, that makes perfect sense. All I have to say is they better get this remodel done soon. It won't be pretty if I run out of coke and can't find it because they've relocated all the fizzy drinks and put them in among the jock straps and mouthguards. My Target addiction might be strong, but its nothing compared to my coke addiction. If I'm unable to find my coke, people might just get hurt..."

During those two hours, I was prouder to be a teacher at this school than I have I have ever been proud to be a part of anything. I feel so blessed to be a part of a school that is truly making a difference in students' lives. Making a difference in concrete ways. Making a difference by having a garage sale to earn money to buy two seniors laptops for college. Making a difference by opening the doors to their houses at 10pm to help a student with scholarship essays. Making a difference by demanding excellence because failure is not an option. Making a difference by helping students not just to dream, but to DO. I have some big shoes to fill."

My shyness is this: I don’t like meeting new people, I don’t like talking in front of groups, but I also don’t have Social Anxiety Disorder.

"This same species of man, grown one stage poorer, no longer possessing the strength to interpret, to create fictions, produces nihilists. A nihilist is a man who judges of the world as it is that it ought not to be, and of the world as it ought to be that it does not exist. According to this view, our existence (action, suffering, willing, feeling) has no meaning: the pathos of ""in vain"" is the nihilists' pathos--at the same time, as pathos, an inconsistency on the part of the nihilists."
"Then — the 1980s and 1990s — as now, clerics on Saudi TV were obsessed with women and their orifices, especially what came out of them.

After twelve years, Hans knows very little about himself, except that he does not want to be a grave robber. On the other hand, Angela, the twelve-year-old daughter of the Count and Countess von Schwanenberg knows that she wants to write and perform her marionette plays in all the courts of Europe.

"On Nuclear issue too, how can the US and other “nuclear” nations preach nuclear abstinence to Iran when they themselves are armed to teeth with nuclear warheads, with a combined capacity to destroy the complete world at least 15 times over? (Well, one can die only once, sadly!) What legitimacy does all these nuclear nations have which gives them the moral-or-immoral authority to curb an independent nation’s nuclear ambitions when it is repeatedly proclaiming its peaceful intents? Even if the fact that Iran fought with Iraq for almost a decade but that does not make it a global threat! And by the way, we all know that both these neighboring countries were pitched against each other to neutralize each other and create a conflict zone in the Middle East to suit global arms dealers’ desires. Both Iran and Iraq got used and abused by the West, including the US. The intention was only one: to gain forever access to their huge Oil reserves in order to satiate their ever growing energy demands. Saudi Arabia, the world knew, was never going to be easy to target, anyway, and that is the reason it has never been eyed so far in spite of being the largest Oil producer."
"I find it hard to be critical of a surplus budget brought down by a Leftist government. I never thought to see such a thing in my lifetime. And the fact that the surplus was partly achieved by welfare cuts is all the more amazing. And even the defence cuts did not involve any reduction in personnel numbers. And allowing for business losses to be carried backwards as well as forwards is both innovative and potentially very helpful to business. And lifting the tax-free threshold was WAY overdue."

"In this respect, sinister role of Indian RAW could also be judged from some other events of sectarian violence. In 2008, in Khyber Agency, intermittent fighting between Lashkar-e-Islam and Ansar-ul-Islam had claimed as many as 1500 lives. Lashkar Islami is led by fanatic cleric Mangal Bagh who follows the puritanical Deobandi form of Sunni Islam and has close connections with the extremist Taliban of Afghanistan. Besides other areas of Pakistan, more than 2000 people died in sectarian riots in Kurram Agency, bordering Afghanistan. Its areas have been hit by fierce clashes, pitching Sunni Muslims against the minority Shias. A number of ceasefires was concluded between the warring sects with the help of government officials and the tribal Maliks, but the same proved fruitless owing to the support from Afghanistan where more than hundred training centers covertly established by RAW are supervising anti-Pakistan activities with the tactical help CIA and Mossad."

I am so hopeful that this will be ""real"" - real in the sense that my baby will make it here alive and remain that way. Weird to write that. How many parents think about their pregnancy/expectant child in such a way? Too many, I know."

"Not that his story really needs a lot of exaggeration. He apparently faked illness to distract his guards, and escaped during the night. According to ABC News’ account, which was furnished by one of those who aided Guangcheng in his escape, he climbed a wall, swam across a river, and walked for hours before he was picked up by allies. He’s been blind since childhood, so he had develop sharp hearing, and it’s that which allowed him to navigate through the darkness that slowed his guards’ efforts to find him."

"This morning, second period, with my principal in the room, I had each student and my principal write their name on a piece of paper. I turned the pieces upside down, shuffled them and then set them aside for a moment. Then, I told my students a few true stories. I told them stories of how I had come to find respect and trust in our learning space. I thanked my principal and asked her to step out. Then, slowly, with honesty and love, I drew one piece of paper at a time. Slow, as I read each name in turn, I thanked each student for the gifts they have offered me over the last 9 weeks. We cried. And we spent the rest of the day laughing, awash in tears, gratitude and reflection."
"It also gave Stacey a secret. He knew that Mattias didn't know much about cooking. No spice, or assortment of spices, could possibly remove the taste of Andrill from potatoes. Potatoes are like sponges, they soak up every flavor around them. The trick to removing Andrill from them was not in the cooking, but in the sack they were carried in. Stacey's mother, before she died, taught Stacey how to make a sack, and what to make it out of, that cleaned produce in such a way that it pulled out contaminants, like Andrill in general. The flavor of Andrill was out of those potatoes a few hours after Stacey was on the boat. It still made him happy though, because potatoes, like sponges, really have no flavor all by themselves. So, for Mattias to have said anything, Stacey did have his spices right. His mashed potatoes were good. Come out of Andrill and still deserve praise good."

Chloe has been a tad jealous of her sister Pearl who was named ""Student of the Month"" in both KG and 1st grade. She has been hoping every month since that it would be her turn. I was a little bit concerned that she might not achieve this status because she can be a bit difficult. Now, finally her dream has become a reality. Not only did Chloe earn this wonderful honor, but her best friend, who is in another class, won the very same honor. I thought it was pretty cool that two best friends both won ""Student of the Month"" for the same thing at the exact same time!"

"I had absolutely no shame in cheating in GTAIII. Instantly getting the fuzz off my back after going on a killing spree was such a relief. The no wanted level cheat was probably the first among GTA cheats that I memorized. And the weapons cheat. Ohhhh, the weapons cheat. Shooting people with a pistol is alright. Burning them to a crisp with the flame thrower, blowing them up with a rocket launcher? AWESOME. The rocket launcher was especially delightful to use. At times I would find some high ground and start shooting people and nuking cars. When the cops brought out a helicopter, I'd just take aim and it was down in a matter of seconds. But the granddaddy of all cheats would have to be spawning a tank. Talk about power. The tank was nigh unstoppable. Any car it touched was instantly blown up, which made me laugh like a madman every time police cars would try to stop me. The tank has never been as strong in a GTA game as it has in GTAIII, able to take a sizable amount of punishment before you can't use it anymore. As a result, it isn't as fun to use in later installments. A shame, really."

He had a difficult personality that kept getting in his way. He was fired from the 1925 Ziegfeld revue No Foolin’ for mouthing off to the boss. He blew a contract with Fox Pictures by refusing to get a nose job. Similar bad luck plagued him with his shot at a radio program for Orange Julius, which was canceled after one broadcast."

"Yesterday, Jon and I met with a local pastor who wanted to meet us and see if there was anything they could do to help. What Jon said to him cleared up a lot for me. Apparently Jon is doing the same thing that he did when he was in Afghanistan, which was, keep as busy as possible so you don't have to think about things. He mentioned ""fake it 'til you make it"". Yeah, not at all reassuring to me. How do you do that?? I wish I knew."

"She was breathing deeply, she forgot the cold, the weight of beings, the insane static life, the lone languish of living or dying. After so many years running from fear, fleeing crazily, uselessly, she was finally coming to a halt. At the same time she seemed to be recovering her roots, and the sap rose anew in her body, which was no longer trembling. Pressing her whole body against the parapet, leaning toward the wheeling sky, she was only waiting for her pounding heart to settle down, and for the silence to form in her. The last constellations of stars fell in bunches a little lower on the horizon of the desert, and stood motionless. Then, with an unbearable sweetness, the waters of the night began to fill her, submerging the cold, rising, gradually to the center of her being, and overflowing wave upon wave to her moaning mouth. A moment later, the whole sky stretched out above her as she lay with her back against the cold earth."

"It goes without saying that the relationship is confined to the four corners of the bar. If it’s taken outside then it’s a different one all together and is not the subject of this present post. However, even a relationship with an MD outside the bar turns into a somewhat open relationship because the girlfriend/boyfriend of the MD will have to accept that it’s part of the MD’s job to be sweet to his guests. When the guest is a young female or otherwise falls into the category of the MD’s type, chances are the MD will go all out in being sweet and touchy-feely. A jealous boyfriend/girlfriend might not take that too well. Having and MD for a boyfriend or husband is not for the fainthearted."

The train tracks became a challenging landscape for continued skirmishing, the 99% ers trying to continue to eat and stay warm and sleep, letting the single percenters know that the price paid for amassing inexpressible amounts of wealth far beyond satisfying of wants and needs, was a society getting stripped of any decent public amenities, or else plastic would have to again become the scab picket line crosser and offer a fischer price kinda fix for the public’s safety, and because there was no other answer to the movements lately moving, the Occupy movement, the SEIU movement, the Anonymous charge across previously unchallenged firewalls surrounding all the confidential valuable evidence of the true nature of wealth getting wealthy in a country practically on sale to treasury-rich China and other highly intelligent growing shareholders preparing for the USA‘s next bake sale, another private offering, initial, secondary, tertiary…it has got to be done! in the face of economic fragility, real estate discrepancy, silicon valley bubble-forming and pressing on and on, full of hot air at the height of 1999, and liable to repeat itself from here on forward, 2012, just you wait and see, because the stock market is most enjoyed when the single percenters are fucking channeling your 401Ks and 403Bs into inflated, modelled, masked, hotrod web presences who will fly into celestial released confetti drops of cashed in stock options called to earth mere days after IPO‘s hit the tape, despite ongoing efforts to prevent the maelstrom, grassroots bodies en masse to block off the wall street circulation this summer, just to maybe stop some deals from going so smoothly, due to disruptions unanticipated and costly, perhaps."

"The first EP, The Serpentine Similar (Dexter's Cigar, 1993), with the collaboration of John McEntire, is a deeply experimental record. Apart from a few scant touches by McEntire on percussion, the tracks are arranged for guitar and bass only or for piano and bass (in rare exceptions voice too). What sets this music apart isn't so much its bare arrangements, but rather the ambiguous incongruities in its harmony."

"After the parade came the Fireworks. Yes, we were super close to the castle, but didn’t want to stay THAT close. We made our way back and then realized our mistake. Main Street was PACKED. A Cast Member holding a light up in the air said, “If you want to watch the Fireworks, follow me…” so we kind of “crowd dove” through a ton of people and she led us to an open patch where no one was standing! Pretty crazy! We were also WAY closer so that Cast Member received a gold star in my opinion!!!"
"Anyway... on with the freebie. It is 6 ""what am I"" poems and a recording sheet for students to write their guesses and support them with proof from each poem. I did it as a ""Scoot"" type activity where I put the kids into 6 groups, each group went to a poem, read the poem, wrote their guess/proof, and then ""scooted"" to the next poem on my signal. It was fun and interesting for me to see the difference in the thinking between the three grade levels! My K kiddos didn't quite get the ""proof"" thing, but the 1st and 2nd graders did well on that! Not having taught K before, being with the three littles that are in my intervention group has been fun!"

"“Farther Away” begins with Franzen going to an isolated island to do some bird watching and be alone in nature. He takes along Robinson Crusoe is sets off in search of a rare bird species, planning to eschew most modern conveniences, read the book, and write about the solitary experiences. He also plans to spread some of Wallace’s ashes on the island, imagining his friend would love his ashes being spread on a beautiful island that’s hard to get to. As Franzen fights a losing battle with nature, he begins to process some of of the grief and anger that he’s held at bay in the years since his friend’s death. I was stunned by the power of his words and by his brutal insights into Wallace’s suicide. SPOILER ALERT:"

"This lets me have some fun 'cause all my flannels are from when I planned on cloth diapering Sunshine with some AIOs (all in ones are like washable disposable diapers with velcro tabs). We ended up using EC (Elimination Communication ) and didn't need any extra diapers so...I've a LOT of flannel. Since I'm gender neutral I picked out all the fabric I found cute. There's Bad to the Bone, Unicorns, little toadstools, Frogs, Knights with Castles, motorcycles, space, a Supergirl...just lots. I take silky ribbons that I keep every year and after 'wrapping' it like you would with paper I wrap it with the ribbon. Sometimes I'll pull it up and have this poof of fabric with a big bow. That looks nice for the solid colors. I'll take some pictures of ours to share with ya'll and hopefully you can use the idea next year. Remember...after Christmas sells!"

Rest assured the grog will not just sit in my fridge and be necked whilst I lounge on the couch farting and watching documentaries on channel four about fat kids, and laughing my head off when they run. Of course I’ll have to check the grog for quality control purposes, but the Belgians will be welcome to come and pick up their grog any time they like."

"Apparently there is no need to discover if allegations are true nowadays. Just the fact that someone has been accused by anonymous sources is enough to convict - at least in the press. So much for innocent until proven guilty. Proof of a settlement is no proof at all, particularly when it comes to sexual harassment allegations. It is routine for large companies to pay off on claims like this as it is far cheaper (even at $45,000) than investigating and defending a suit. Ultimately, a southern man - particularly of a certain age - calling someone 'darling' is as much sexual harassment as Brigadier General Michael Walsh's calling Senator Barbara Boxer 'ma'am' was an attempt to somehow demean her. Ridiculous."
"You look down and close your eyes, droopy. Then expand and stand tall. Raise your face to the sky, turn your hands out, and ask. Out loud. Ask for what you want with your whole heart. (I did it a few times, and it worked so profoundly, I was scared to ask any more. Mistake!)"

He didn’t bother looking at the time, by the way the professor looked around, he knew the bell was going to ring in any minute. Then, he’d be able to go and fix any problem his family had that day. Sure, they’d yell and scream at him, but he’d get the job done one way or another."

"A wise (non-Muslim) friend once told me how her (wealthy and financially astute) father drew her attention to the fact that ‘the highest buildings belonged to insurance companies’, illustrating the highly profitable nature of their business. Their exaggerated profitability stems from the above mentioned odds. Interestingly, insurance companies seem to be virtually single-handedly keeping the South African Broadcasting Corporation afloat through hours-long loops of ‘infomercials’ and at least one advert during every ad break. The insurance industry is just another means through which money is sucked out of the economy in an unproductive way, making less money available for actual consumer goods. So no wonder ‘real ‘ companies probably don’t have budget to advertise on tv."

"Some may call it an unfair judgement having not given the whole film a proper chance but I think it’s fairly clear why I gave up after about twenty minutes. There was no originality, the actors were rather 2D and uninspired, and the whole sequence I saw seemed like a poor man’s remake of Cameron’s version."

"Since the 1980s the Greens have been telling everyone that carbon dioxide was causing global warming—now called climate change—and warning that CO2 emissions were going to kill everyone in the world if they weren’t dramatically reduced.

"About 2 weeks ago I was looking at Art House Co-Op when a theme, Stitches and Folds, caught my eye and suddenly I was thinking clearly about drawing and note making that might lead to the creation of some textile work. I knew straight away how to work with this theme, both as a sketchbook for the project and as the basis of new work of my own, so I signed up. I’ve been transported back several decades to when I was doing needlework as a school subject and the endless samples of seams, tuck, pleats and darts that had to be worked. Suddenly I was seeing a mixed media sketchbook and larger textile pieces celebrating this functional stitching. My initial initial sketchbook is a very basic one I had on hand that has just kicked off my thinking and enabled me to get some simple preliminary thoughts down."

"Anyhoo, long story short, lots and lots of blacks in my last neighborhood. Like, every other house. So I was jogging in one of the tonier areas of my neighborhood and there are two dogs in the front yard of this one house. They went after me like I was made out of ham. All I got was a tiny nip on the ankle. They weren’t large dogs, but they were large enough to put a scare in me. Scared, angry me stood in the middle of the street, kind of paralyzed, screaming for the home owners to get their fucking dogs. A large black man comes out of the house behind me. I snippily ask if these are his dogs. He patiently says “No.” and proceeds to clear the way for me. The dogs are intimidated by his height and decidedly not-defensive posture. They slunk away. I offered an effusive “Thank you, Sir!” and continued jogging home. I was shaken. But felt extraordinarily grateful for the nice, big, calm guy who came to my rescue. More big black guys for my neighborhood, please."
"With just a tiny bit of prep during the weekend, a plate of delicious scrambled eggs is less than 5 minutes away. Seriously. You can time it. I’ll provide a recipe for you to try out, but really, the perfect weekday eggs are more of a method. When you have a little extra free time in the kitchen, pull out your food processor and puree some scramble-worthy vegetables and olive oil. I used a tomato, shallot, and parsley but I think mushrooms, zucchini, and/or spinach would be other good options. Store the concoction in the fridge and use it as the base for your scrambled eggs when you’re in a hurry. As a bonus, I found that this method yields consistently nice, soft scrambled eggs (as opposed to those dry, overcooked bits you might get when you’re rushing to get out the door and trying to multi-task…oops.) I’m not sure why this is, but I’ll take it."

"Oh yeah, back to the movie, how does all this EPR rambling tie in to the movie? Well, I really wish I had seen it when Eran Kolirin was still here, because I would've loved to quiz him about it. But I can say that festival programmer Rod Armstrong introduced the movie by saying in previous Q&A's some audience members wanted to ascribe mental health issues (anything from depression to schizophrenia) to the protagonist, and Eran was adamant that he's not crazy in any way. Well, that's easy for me--he's not crazy, he's just a physicist. And his class ends one day when he's right in the middle of discussing EPR. So he goes home with all this at the front of his mind, keenly aware he's collapsing Wave Functions all around him. Well, as a guy, what's the one thing that is most profound to collapse by observing. That's right, his own penis. So he takes a second, whips it out, and looks at it in the mirror. Then he notices another guy watching him. And wacky hijinx ensue."

"We stayed in Chennai for a few days and then decided to get a train to Pondicherry. I had wanted to visit Pondicherry ever since reading a wonderful book, Life of Pi, which begins in that city. Pondicherry is still heavily influenced by all things French as it was formerly a French colony. There are lots of very pretty pastel houses in streets with French names and in fact the city is divided into the French quarter and the Indian quarter and lots of people living there speak in French, which was bit disconcerting! It sits beside the Bay of Bengal and has lovely stretches of clean beaches and plenty of interesting shops. It`s known as a holiday get away for Indians and we liked it so much we stopped there for several days. Indian women go paddling in their sari`s and it`s just incredibly rich and colourful to see. The police, many of them women, wear uniforms of pale and dark blue camouflage. One time I bought some candy floss from a guy on the beach and a police officer came up to him rapping his knuckle with her baton, she told him to give me more bags and that he had ripped me off, as if I really minded. The only strange event I witnessed was when a very, very old lady came on to the beach, she was filthy dirty and obviously had some sort of mental health issue. Smiling and laughing to herself, she slowly twirled around on the sand then gradually lifting her swirling skirts she sank to the beach and poo`d. Nobody seemed to mind and that`s India for you."

"For instance, we learn that in the sixteenth century Conrad Dasypodius, a Swiss mathematician, could have chosen to restore the old Clock of the Three Kings in Strasbourg Cathedral. Dasypodius, however, preferred to build a new clock of his own rather than maintain an old one. Over two centuries later, Jean-Baptiste Schwilgue was asked to repair the clock built by Dasypodius, but he decided to build a new and better clock which would last for 10,000 years."

"In conclusion, it’s interesting to watch these self-publishers go commercial. I don’t think any of them have succeeded as much as they did with self-publishing; it’s probably because a) the process was rushed and somewhat ignored because the books already have found its audience and should therefore go on the market ASAP and b) these authors just weren’t built for commercial publication. Their books weren’t, either, which is probably why they didn’t go that route (for whatever reason) in the first place."

For some, it was their beer of the festival. These reports of it's greatness turned out to be true. I adored the pungent fruit nose, the gloriously lush resinous hop kick and big, bold, crisp zing of the pineapple and passion fruit that's balanced beautifully with a robust malt spine. A solid and lovely drinking 5.6% gem. A wowser of a beer."

Of course the first thing I did, after shakily receiving J.’s reassurances that “If anyone can do this, you can,” was hit the grocery store near my office on lunch break so I could stock up on a handful of items to make the first week easier. Almond milk – check. Gluten-free pancake mix, for emergencies – check. Organic popcorn crisps for a school snack – check. And, to be completely honest, a box of Rice Chex cereal. No, ordinarily, I don’t buy boxed cereals for the boys. And I’m not sure how proud I am of the purchase. But I knew L. was familiar with Chex from school and elsewhere, and it made me feel better to pick up something that would seem sort of normal to him while I was feeling food-haywire."

"What unfortunately follows is – with the software application acting as a security blanket of project management commitment – true PM techniques and principles are often never learned (nor the application, mind you). Firms utilize the “accidental project management” approach, throw a few activities into an .mpp file, and focus much of their effort on the maximizing the practice of “project management by powerpoint” As a consultant, the most important thing to remember is this – Project Management is in the eye of the beholder (no matter what PMI or PRINCE2 or any other BOK may say.) If your client manages projects through Ouija boards and crayons, then so do you. We must learn to adapt and apply what we’ve learned as project managers to each client and each situation. As PM’s, we should never force feed. We must suggest, nurture, cajole – introduce slowly the project management concepts we know and love – and are enablers of success!. After all, they hired us to be project managers, right?"

They're easier to carry, easier to store and quicker to cool. I'm led to believe than aluminium is a much better recycling material than glass, so they're green too. They certainly take up a lot less space when empty (and crushed)."

As soon as I reach my destination, my excitement builds, my eyes dance around from the assembled tables of each vendor, and I forget the items on my list and buy with my eyes! Knowing the produce I select has not traveled far from the very ground it grew in, makes my choice of vegetables even more special."
"The last time Mercury was retrograde directly opposite your sign was in September 2009. This is always an indication that you have to face old issues with partners, especially ex-partners. It could mean you are similarly dealing with old issues with close friends as well. Whatever the case, all this stuff is back on your plate again. Oy! The downside of Mercury is feeling frustrated with delays. But the upside of Mercury (and incredibly, there is an upside) is that you can quite easily expedite things or finish things or bring them to a conclusion now. Wouldn't it be nice to get rid of this once and for all? Some of you, however, are not dealing with old issues. You're just running into ex-partners -- and all that that implies. (Yikes!)"

"Why has there not been any serious public criticism of the determined impropriety of having completely nude women and men (standing a yard apart), shamelessly facing each other in a doorway, between whom visitors must squeeze in order to enter a popular exhibition these days in the Museum of Modern Art in New York City? Is not gross impropriety evident both on the part of those who mount such a display and on the part of those who attend this two-month-long exhibit in large numbers? Do not such ugly indulgences testify to an ominous decadence among our most privileged fellow-citizens, a deterioration that corrupts everyone involved, recklessly undermining thereby the moral foundations of our republican institutions?

"This morning, second period, with my principal in the room, I had each student and my principal write their name on a piece of paper. I turned the pieces upside down, shuffled them and then set them aside for a moment. Then, I told my students a few true stories. I told them stories of how I had come to find respect and trust in our learning space. I thanked my principal and asked her to step out. Then, slowly, with honesty and love, I drew one piece of paper at a time. Slow, as I read each name in turn, I thanked each student for the gifts they have offered me over the last 9 weeks. We cried. And we spent the rest of the day laughing, awash in tears, gratitude and reflection."

"The culturing of meditation into our system is normal. Some people call it the higher state of consciousness, I call it the normal state of consciousness since we are endowed with the ability to live in that state. Meditation helps in two ways-it prevents stress from getting into the system and simultaneously helps release already accumulated stress. Regular meditation also leads to happiness and fulfillment; to sensitisation of the sensory organs (thereby intensifying the experiences of seeing, tasting, feeling, etc.); and to greater intuitiveness."

"What unfortunately follows is – with the software application acting as a security blanket of project management commitment – true PM techniques and principles are often never learned (nor the application, mind you). Firms utilize the “accidental project management” approach, throw a few activities into an .mpp file, and focus much of their effort on the maximizing the practice of “project management by powerpoint” As a consultant, the most important thing to remember is this – Project Management is in the eye of the beholder (no matter what PMI or PRINCE2 or any other BOK may say.) If your client manages projects through Ouija boards and crayons, then so do you. We must learn to adapt and apply what we’ve learned as project managers to each client and each situation. As PM’s, we should never force feed. We must suggest, nurture, cajole – introduce slowly the project management concepts we know and love – and are enablers of success!. After all, they hired us to be project managers, right?"

"The negativity that results from this line of argument can be qualified by way of Noys’ excellent introduction, which describes affirmationism’s emergence from two prior theoretical trends. The first of these trends is a nihilistic, post-1968 tendency to align emancipatory potential with the unleashing of capital flows (linked to the early 1970′s work of Baudrillard, Deleuze and Lyotard); but having been rendered untenable by the realities of 1980′s neo-liberalism, this is said to have given rise to a subsequent interest in linking opposition to transcendence, difference, and otherness. Affirmationism’s concerns with immanent, but also oppositional forms synthesised these two tendencies, and Noys shares its consequent avoidance of associating oppositional negativity with either immanence or transcendence: he contends that a focus on the generation of immanent difference would echo the operation of real abstraction, whilst transcendent externality mirrors the ‘void’ of abstract value itself. His account of negativity as ‘immanent rupture’ (17) is not associated with either pole: it is ‘internal’ (128) to the positivity that it contests, but it exists in a ‘relation of rupture’ (172) with it."

"ONCE UPON A TIME, a little boy with a big sword went into battle against Mister Rogers. Or maybe, if the truth be told, Mister Rogers went into battle against a little boy with a big sword, for Mister Rogers didn’t like the big sword. It was one of those swords that really isn’t a sword at all; it was a big plastic contraption with lights and sound effects, and it was the kind of sword used in defense of the universe by the heroes of the television shows that the little boy liked to watch. The little boy with the big sword did not watch Mister Rogers. In fact, the little boy with the big sword didn’t know who Mister Rogers was, and so when Mister Rogers knelt down in front of him, the little boy with the big sword looked past him and through him, and when Mister Rogers said, “Oh, my; that’s a big sword you have,” the boy didn’t answer, and finally his mother got embarrassed and said, “Oh, honey, c’mon, that’s Mister Rogers,” and felt his head for fever. Of course, she knew who Mister Rogers was, because she had grown up with him, and she knew that he was good for her son, and so now, with her little boy zombie-eyed under his blond bangs, she apologized, saying to Mister Rogers that she knew he was in a rush and that she knew he was here in Penn Station taping his program and that her son usually wasn’t like this, he was probably just tired …. Except that Mister Rogers wasn’t going anywhere. Yes, sure, he was taping, and right there, in Penn Station in New York City, were throngs of other children wiggling in wait for him, but right now his patient gray eyes were fixed on the little boy with the big sword, and so he stayed there, on one knee, until the little boy’s eyes finally focused on Mister Rogers, and he said, “It’s not a sword; it’s a death ray.” A death ray! Oh, honey, Mommy knew you could do it …. And so now, encouraged, Mommy said, “Do you want to give Mister Rogers a hug, honey?” But the boy was shaking his head no, and Mister Rogers was sneaking his face past the big sword and the armor of the little boy’s eyes and whispering something in his ear–something that, while not changing his mind about the hug, made the little boy look at Mister Rogers in a new way, with the eyes of a child at last, and nod his head yes."

Well, yes, but this was a different store with different stock, and I was hurting after my first physiotherapy appointment. I also came home with a bundle of super-nostalgic sweets from the old-fashioned sweet emporium, so you can see what kind of mood I was in. Anyway, Arlene Russo's The Real Twilight: True Stories of Modern Day Vampires was the first book I saw, and for £1.99 I thought it might be interesting to see just how far weird vamp-obsession can go. Cash, Johnny Cash's famous autobiography, was tucked under a heap of other books so I plucked that out as well. And just as we were about to leave, I spotted a hardcover copy of Karl Pilkington's An Idiot Abroad hidden behind a big display. I think he's hilarious but his books are usually so darn expensive, so £4.99 seemed a pretty good deal!"
"Jenni, the creative genius behind Sparklewren is one of the most - if not the most - talented and innovative corsetieres in the UK today and I am utterly convinced that one day her name will be whispered in the same breath as Mr Pearl in the highest circles of couture - she has already dressed Immodesty Blaize the Queen of British Showgirls."

After the US invasion, the Sunnis were the most active guerrillas fighting the US presence in country, but recently they were literally paid off using US taxpayer money. US soldiers simply started to give large sums of money to the Sunni leaders in exchange for them not shooting Americans anymore. It worked... somewhat (Americans are of course still targeted, because they are occupying a foreign country etc)."

"I’ve only ever written novels, though I wouldn’t mind a tilt at TV one day. They are very different media which is why you need to change things, substantially sometimes, when you transfer stories between them. Novels work on the imagination and, if they succeed, take the reader directly into the story. TV is a passive medium in which the screen is the boss and says ‘Watch now’ until it’s done. And you have actors in TV – wonderful actors in the case of The Killing, which means they can get away with unresolved narrative issues which would never be allowed in a book. TV has a visceral immediacy and the ability to mix the visual, the auditory and the dramatic in a way that can root you to the spot. Books are more subtle it seems to me, and ultimately more memorable. My take on The Killing departs from the TV version in some very significant ways, especially at the end. But it’s been interesting that some devoted Killing followers haven’t spotted that. It’s because TV is very much of the moment, I suspect. You’re a spectator, not a participant as you are in a good book. That said I’d still like to write TV before long – it’s such an adventurous and ambitious medium in the right hands."

"Of course, most practising vampires drain the life from an unblood once in a while, but most make sure they have a careful balance between kills and the safer consumption of vampire blood. After all, in terms of quality the taste of vampire blood is generally more satisfying, more complex and bolder in its flavour than that of a normal, unconverted human being. And the most delicious blood of all, the Pinot Rouge every blood lover knows is the best on offer, is the blood taken from someone’s veins the moment after conversion."

"I didn’t get to take a look at the chemistry exam, because they told me that if I entered the room to look at the exam, I’d have to stay there for the entire two hours. Staring at the exam for two hours without a chance to solve most of the tasks (we got test-exams from our tutor, so I know I’m not even close to the required level for passing) would have greatly increased negative feelings about myself and caused me a lot of anxiety, so I opted out of that option. The problem isn’t that I couldn’t sit the exam: since the Christmas holidays I’ve been aware that I had fallen way behind my schedule – what annoyed me was that I had learned about the palaeontology test on Thursday, but registered for the chemistry exam on Tuesday. Had I known about the test only a few days earlier, I wouldn’t have signed up for the exam in the first place and thus saved that attempt. But, there’s no use crying over spilt milk…"
"We Americans take strange pride in our byzantine approach to regulations. We have a federal minimum wage, but individual states have their own minimum wages, sometimes special minimum wages for teenagers or part-time workers. One teensy-weensy flaw in our system is that even the federal minimum wage is not a living wage — for anyone not living on their sister’s couch, it leaves you about $6,000 p/a short of what you need to survive."

"I’ve written extensively about ways to restrain the economic power of the wealthy, which largely point to making our tax system more progressive and harder to evade, eliminating corporate welfare, and regulating financial capital to the point where it’s “safe, stable, and boring.” One rare area where there is widespread popular support for progressive causes is tax fairness – witness the popularity of the “Buffett Rule” in the U.S, the unpopularity of Chancellor Osborne’s decision to lower the top income bracket in the U.K, and Hollande of the French Socialists staking his platform on a top tax rate of 75% on the wealthiest."

"Besides the health, financial, and environmental reasons, there is of course the ethical reason. Is it correct that 70 Billion animals are raised each year only to become food for humans? The vast majority of these animals live lives of such unimaginable squalor and suffering as to dull the senses. There seems to be a widespread idea that animals, for some reason, don’t feel pain or suffering like humans, or that they only exist to feed humans. These are such juvenile ideas that they would almost be laughable if they weren’t so repugnant. Notwithstanding the active abuse dished out to untold numbers of animals and the horrible conditions that they inhabit during their short, sad lives, the worst part of this issue is the fact that most humans feel that there is nothing wrong in our very mentally which justifies the slavery and subservience of all other animals to our appetites and whims, and that humans are naturally superior and ordained to dominate and rule the earth because we are the most intelligent species. This is an example of an intelligence I want no part of. We are animals too, and this slavery and abuse is unacceptable and should not be tolerated or even allowed."

"So that’s the main thing I remember about that film. And then, of course, it was a disaster when it came out - and almost immediately it also turned into a cult film – and it still is! Frankly, I don’t quite understand why – except that there’s no movie remotely like it. I saw it again a little over 10 years ago at a film festival in Dallas. They wanted me to come down because they couldn’t get anyone else so I went. And the category it was in was called “Films We Love to Hate”. And I thought wait a minute, they didn’t tell me that! And then I was interviewed in front of an audience at a midnight showing. They were asking me about Otto Preminger. And I said he was one of the great film directors and everybody laughed out loud. Then I started to list a number of movies that are remarkable and have some range. And at every one I said, they would laugh. “Wait a minute,” I said, “This is not being fair.” “Yeah, but Skidoo - we hear it’s terrible.” And I said, “Every film director who’s made a lot of movies has made a couple that don’t work – and by the way Skidoo does have a following.” So then I settled down with them to watch the film and I was like, “Oh God, it is terrible. It’s awful.” He was trying for something original and unusual – and he was challenging himself – but he didn’t know how to do it. It just wasn’t his thing."

"Jenni, the creative genius behind Sparklewren is one of the most - if not the most - talented and innovative corsetieres in the UK today and I am utterly convinced that one day her name will be whispered in the same breath as Mr Pearl in the highest circles of couture - she has already dressed Immodesty Blaize the Queen of British Showgirls."
"However, it turns out that I've been getting my priorities in a muddle - because having sampled St Peter's 'Organic Ale' I was very swiftly reminded that 'freshness', 'authenticity' and 'a distinct absence of extraneous chemicals and processes' - when assembled together as a code of brewing practice - are pretty much guaranteed to result in the most marvellous of ales."

"I don’t understand the groups. I’ve searched on there for a job, once or twice, and had some interest once, only once. These kind of results make me feel like it’s pointless, but yet I have an account because, well, everyone else has one. I think of Linkedin the way I think about those plastic, photo-inserts in my wallet. Sure, I have them, but I don’t ever use them, at least not for their intended purpose. I may jam a receipt in there every now and again, but they certainly don’t contain photos! I mean, my photos are on my phone! Isn’t that the way it goes now?"

"And I have the firm belief in this now,"
"Rrs usually stains."
"We then cruised back to the pier, had a spot of lunch and took the bus back to Ha Noi. We all really enjoyed our time on Ha Long Bay in the Chinese Junk Boat, but the scenery wasn’t really new to us after seeing southern Thailand and the more sparse islands around there, so it would have probably been more impressive if we had been here first. Saying that it was very pretty and would definitely recommend seeing it, but if you had to choose between the two I would say Krabi was nicer!"
"If I like sniffing pages of a brand new book, I must say that the steep price has eventually put me off. I favor low prices old books that you can still hunt out in some second-hand bookshops. Travel through time starts there."

"We have been in full prep mode for Pooh Bear. I had my second shower last Saturday thrown by my sweet friends at work, where I haven't actually worked since February, and we received so many thoughtful gifts. They are a group of incredibly kind and generous ladies and it was so great seeing everyone and celebrating the upcoming arrival of our girl!"
"In closing, for those seeking quests for 'older' and more 'mature' audiences, one of my favorite quests was Monty Python's Monty Python and the Holy Grail. Here is a brilliant excerpt I hope you enjoy (the quality of the YouTube clip isn't great, but it is good enough and well worth the view):"
"All Taib needs is another cabinet reshuffle, then Awang Tengah can override Jabu , Mawan and Masing because he is no more dependent on Pesaka, SPDP and PRS ."

"Now for the good one! The authors Diana diZerega Wall and Anne-Marie Cantwell, are professors of anthropology at the City University of New York and Rutgers University-Newark, respectively. They have put together these walking tours, in all the boroughs except Staten Island*, to help tourist and resident alike learn more about the history of the city."
"I’m letting myself go again, I can sense it, and the taste of takeaway food follows me like a newly purchased kitten. Pizza, wine and dope fill the air and scatter across the living room floor like dry ice settling on some northern moor in a shockingly bad horror film. And that really pains me - as I'm a clean bloke!"
"A couple of weeks ago three of my peers and I went down to Joplin, Mo. for a day. We left with a list of about five churches we were hoping to visit when we got there and a lot of anxiety about what we were going to see when we got there. Our goal was to report on thanks and faith in Joplin, and try to get at what the first Thanksgiving was going to be like after an extreme natural disaster."
"Don't get me wrong, I want him to grow and do all the things a little boy should, but not too quickly. He's already in 3-6 months clothes and it seems like just yesterday I was being admitted into L&D. And that's a story if there ever was one."
"“I’ll wait for you by the lift” she said then turned hoping her previous thoughts hadn’t left a damp patch on her skirt."
"- Keep your portfolio and CV up to date"
"If happiness is our primary goal, we’ll get a divorce as soon as happiness seems to wane. If receiving love is our primary goal, we’ll dump our spouse as soon as they seem to be less attentive. But if we marry for the glory of God, to model His love and commitment to our children, and to reveal His witness to the world, divorce makes no sense."

"Isn't my little Leprechaun the cutest ever?"
"Join corner B to corner D and press. Do the same thing for all the other squares that are above the fold line."
"I am taking the 'Complaint-Free Challenge.' I will try (along with others) to go 31 days without complaining. I am trying to replace my baditude with God's word and gratitude. Cheri Gregory has this wonderful idea and I am really excited and a little nervous about this, but I think it will be pleasing to God. Anytime we try to better ourselves and try to be Christ like, it pleases God."
"It isn't going to be all rainbows and unicorns of course. Life has bumps but I absolutely refuse to focus on them. They're irrelevant. I'll get through, I'll not only survive but I will thrive! Because I have, with practice, learned how to flip the coin and see the positive side."

"well I think I am going to go to bed and see if I can get some sleep .. my eyes are very gritty and I have a bit of double vision happening .. haha .. so I am hoping what I have written actually makes sense ... or at the very least .. legible ..."
"This is the post where I go all Loco about Valentine's Day. It's a nice holiday and all, but its not for me. It's mostly commercial, and as my dear husband has pointed out before, ""Every day is like Valentine's Day when you live with him."" That used to bug the crap out of me, but you know I totally get it. If we can't be nice and do kind things for each other 364 days out of the year, then that one day, Valentine's Day, isn't really going to make any difference even if Hallmark tells us to... I'm not completely anti, I do buy my kids a treat and a card."
"These disturbing PSA ads by Juvenile Protective Association visually illustrate that “Verbal abuse is still abuse.” And unlike physical abuse which leaves visible marks on the outside, you are leaving wounds with your words that may take a young kid a lifetime to heal. These ads were created by EuroRSCG Chicago, USA."

"the trees outside."
"Straight away the DellArte site strikes a perspective author as being clean, crisp, well presented, and certainly big on words like ‘dreams’ and ‘aspirations’. We should be familiar now with this author solution services speak, after all, DellArte is run by the same company who now own such illustrious author solutions services as Xlibris, Trafford, iUniverse and AuthorHouse. In fact, looking through DellArte Press’ web pages, I’m sure I recognise some of those aspiring authors used in many of the advertising graphics. Seems, Author Solutions may have had a strong hand in the design and presentation of this site—so it makes sense the male and female models are the same!"

"I can’t believe how long it’s been since I’ve done a post on here. Dec. 31, 2010 was my last post, so my apologies to my subscribers or those checking in. I have thought about doing a post for so long, yet somehow each day, as I tell myself I will do one today! – I don’t. I can’t for the life of me figure out why I procrastinate so much, they say there has to be a pay off, but I can’t figure it out. Do any of you procrastinate? How do you overcome it? I know with blogging that it’s essential to be consistent and yet I don’t. A little self-sabotage me thinks! Please share with me any tips you have to stop procrastinating by leaving a comment, I just love getting comments!"

"Backing up a few weeks ago, Simon and Ava headed to Iowa on Monday, March 21st to visit Omi over Ava's spring break. It was fun for Ava and Simon to have a father daughter road trip to Iowa while also enjoying some quality time with Omi. Here's Ava going down the this cool, old slide at Crapo park that Simon use to play on when he was younger."

"hurt the economy"
"It was at this point that – with pc at its height – the northern half of the EU (Northern France, Holland and Germany) made its most catastrophic denial of reality….by allowing into the so-called EMU – today known as the Eurozone – member States threatening two distinct econo-cultural obstacles to success: (1) an ability to compete economically; and (2) a track-record of poor fiscal management."
"Over the past 40 years, median house prices have doubled relative to household incomes in the Golden State. Why? In 1998, Dartmouth economist William Fischel found that California's housing had been nearly as affordable as the rest of the nation until the more restrictive regulations, such as development moratoria, urban growth boundaries, and overly expensive impact fees came into effect starting in the 1970s. Other economic studies, such as by Stephen Malpezzi at the University of Wisconsin, also have documented the strong relationship between more intense land-use regulations and exorbitant house prices."

"My mom always smells really good; I’m pretty sure she smells better than all the other moms out there."
"Sorvino does nothing but flirt with Nicole, presented in such detail that the film practically becomes a romantic comedy for a short period. Because that’s really what I wanted in a movie called The Stuff; a fat balding middle aged man hitting on a woman. Truly they picked the right focus for this picture. Oh and there’s a few minor parts in there about The Stuff coming to life and killing people…but that doesn’t matter too much…"

"I didn't love it, but it was functional. A few weeks back, we had an intern at the brewery who suggested using shower heads like he had seen at another brewery. GREAT idea! And very easy to put into place, plus giving me the opportunity to make it look prettier. Sometimes, even if it works fine, if it's ugly I hate it. I have to look at it all the time. So.... about $20 in parts and now we have a much better, more sightly bottle rinser. Next up, air knife to dry them."
"""Nobody wants to give books to a writer,"" a relative told me. ""It would be like we were setting up unreasonably high bar for your book."" And then, I swear to god, he patted me on the head. Which, for those of you watching at home, is how Midwesterners participate in the soft tyranny of low expectations. (Also, I would like to say yet another prayer of thanksgiving that none of my relatives know how to work the internet.)"

"Two of my five kids have food allergies to items like dairy, eggs, and nuts. It has been a 17 year mission for me to make sure that there day to day lives did not feel any more restricted than any other child. I wanted them to be able to eat the same foods as the rest of us, or better."
"I find it hard to be critical of a surplus budget brought down by a Leftist government. I never thought to see such a thing in my lifetime. And the fact that the surplus was partly achieved by welfare cuts is all the more amazing. And even the defence cuts did not involve any reduction in personnel numbers. And allowing for business losses to be carried backwards as well as forwards is both innovative and potentially very helpful to business. And lifting the tax-free threshold was WAY overdue."
"I pick my toast up. I love toast. Mom. I love my toast. Mom. I love you toast. Mom. I eat my toast, ham and potatoes and then I get applesauce? I eat applesauce, swig milk and find piece for Al's bike in no time? Where my...my...my...my...my flashlight? It's a kid's flashlight. It's a toy flashlight. You find it for me? You find it for me? Mom. I go in ga'age and find piece for Al's bike in no time, right?! I love you toast, Mom."
"The bill, which passed the full Senate earlier this month, would require all state sexual education classes to “exclusively and emphatically” promote abstinence while banning teachers from promoting any form of “gateway sexual activity.” The latter term, which has garnered national media attention and been lampooned by comedian Stephen Colbert, is not specifically defined in the bill."
"The honest answer is; apart from the web, we’re not entirely sure how we’re going to do this yet. This is something traditional publishers do as part of the process for each book and possibly another appealing aspect of traditional publishers. But I’ve also heard they can do very little to push a book, so it’s a tough one to call."
"If things were not going strange enough, last night, I got hit with malware on the computer. I was searching for some transmission drawings on the internet and hit a site that started trying to scan my computer for errors, trying to sell me data recovery software and showed all kinds of warnings. I could not close it out. I performed a virus scan and a hard drive scan. The scans made it appear that all my files were there, but I could not find anything! Most of the night, the scans ran but this morning it was no better. After returning from the dentist, I had a thought and ran a ""System Restore"" to a time before the event occurred. Sure enough the computer was restored to the configuration from the previous day. The malware was gone and all my files are back. The only thing missing is my Favorites on my browser. I need to fiqure out if those can be reloaded. I am happy this worked, I thought I was going to have to take the computer somewhere and pay to get it fixed."

"15-13 against the Phillies, won in the bottom of the 12th with a walk off home run by Chipper! The old man still has it! The Braves still have it! We came back from six to nothing and what a battle it was. I didn't think anything could top McCann's grand slam."
"She has been so “attitudey” lately too. I keep feeling a “spicey” vibe. I don’t know if it’s just because I have Ronan on the brain on the time or what. Even with her sassiness, spicey-iness, whatever, I just love her. I love being around her. We have so much fun 99.7% of the time. Her sass tends to be more funny than anything else. It’s so awesome. Sometimes I get this vibe…a vibe that I am going to have a life surrounded by Rockstar’s. Children really are my world. I just adore them. Every single one. It is going to be so awesome…I am looking forward to having a life filled with children."
