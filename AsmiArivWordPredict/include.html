<h1>What does it do?</h1>

<p>
This application predicts the next word based on selected phrase/word.<br>
So, type a word or phrase under Word/Phrase. Click the predict button. And see the predicted next word.</p>

<p>However, if the word/phrase typed is not available in the dictionary created using the data, the application will display the typed word or may not display anything at all - then move on with another word/phrase. Since, the data contains words from twitter, blogs and news, it may be possible to see unexpected/random words.</p>

<p>The application also plots word-cloud of set of words close to the predicted word.</p>
